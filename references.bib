                   computationally efficient, has little memory requirements,
                   is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is
                   well suited for problems that are large in terms of data

                   and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive
                   interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some

                   proposed solution is fully graph-based, without any need for
                   additional search structures, which are typically used at
                   the coarse search stage of the most proximity graph
                   techniques. Hierarchical NSW incrementally builds a
                   multi-layer structure consisting from hierarchical set of
                   proximity graphs (layers) for nested subsets of the stored
                   elements. The maximum layer in which an element is present
                   is selected randomly with an exponentially decaying
                   probability distribution. This allows producing graphs
                   similar to the previously studied Navigable Small World
                   (NSW) structures while additionally having the links
                   separated by their characteristic distance scales. Starting
                   search from the upper layer together with utilizing the
                   scale separation boosts the performance compared to NSW and

              large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms
              for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain
              algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that
              largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield
              arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case,
              communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the
              algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe
              that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to
              16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the
              Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields
              communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we
              prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it
              converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities

              have not resulted in a unified taxonomy of neuronal or glial cell
              types, partly due to limited data. Single-cell transcriptomics is
              enabling, for the first time, systematic high-throughput
              measurements of cortical cells and generation of datasets that
              hold the promise of being complete, accurate and permanent.
              Statistical analyses of these data reveal clusters that often

              physiological criteria and that appear conserved across cortical

              onset and development of these illnesses cannot be well described
              by the one-gene; one-disease approach. Instead, their clinical
              presentation is thought to result from the regulative interplay
              of a large number of genes. Even though the involvement of many
              genes are likely, up regulating and activation or down regulation
              and silencing of these genes by the environmental factors play a
              crucial role in contributing to their pathogenesis. Much of this
              interplay may be moderated by epigenetic changes. Similar to
              genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications such as DNA
              methylation, histone modifications, and RNA interference can
              influence gene expression and therefore may cause behavioral and
              neuronal changes observed in mental disorders. Environmental
              factors such as diet, gut microbiota, and infections have

              that bioactive nutrients and gut microbiota can alter either DNA
              methylation and histone signatures through a variety of

              de N{\'o} as an anatomically distinct region based on its
              cytoarchitectural features. Although there is an enormous body of
              literature on other hippocampal subfields (CA1 and CA3),
              relatively little is known about the physiological and
              developmental properties of CA2. Here we report identification of
              the CA2 region in the mouse by immunostaining with a Purkinje
              cell protein 4 (PCP4) antibody, which effectively delineates
              CA3/CA2 and CA2/CA1 borders and agrees well with previous
              cytoarchitectural definitions of CA2. The PCP4
              immunostaining-delineated CA2 neurons have distinguishable
              differences in cell morphology, physiology, and synaptic circuit
              connections compared with distal CA3 and proximal CA1 regions.
              The average somatic sizes of excitatory cells differ across
              CA1-3, with the smallest to largest somatic size being
              CA1<CA2<CA3. CA2 excitatory cells have dense dendritic spines,
              but do not have thorny excrescences associated with bordering CA3
              neurons. Photostimulation functional circuit mapping shows that
              CA2 excitatory neurons receives extensive synaptic input from
              CA3, but no detectable input from the dentate gyrus. CA2
              excitatory cells also differ significantly from CA3 cells in
              intrinsic electrophysiological parameters, such as membrane
              capacitance and spiking rates. Although CA2 neurons differ from
              CA1 neurons for PCP4 and other marker expressions, these neurons
              have less distinct neurophysiological and morphological
              properties. Developmental examination revealed that PCP4
              immunostaining first appears at postnatal day 4-5 and becomes
              successively more refined around CA2 until reaching adult form by
              postnatal day 21.",

              brought to light questions concerning the relationship between
              the claustrum (CLA) and a region immediately ventral known as the
              endopiriform nucleus (En). These structures have been identified
              as separate entities in rodents but appear as a single continuous
              structure in primates. During the recent Society for Claustrum
              Research meeting, a panel of experts presented data pertaining to
              the relationship of these regions and held a discussion on
              whether the CLA and En should be considered (a) separate
              unrelated structures, (b) separate nuclei within the same
              formation, or (c) subregions of a continuous structure. This
              review article summarizes that discussion, presenting comparisons

              and anatomical connectivity of the CLA and En across several

              complex, which likely performs analogous computations and exert
              similar effects on their respective cortical targets (e.g.,
              sensorimotor versus limbic). Moving forward, we recommend that
              the field retain the nomenclature currently employed for this
              region but should continue to examine the delineation of these
              structures across different species. Using thorough descriptions
              of a variety of anatomical features, this review offers a clear
              definition of the CLA and En in rodents, which provides a

              cortical microcircuitry as they provide inhibitory input to
              projection (pyramidal) neurons. Despite their involvement in
              various neurological and psychiatric disorders, our knowledge
              about their development in human cerebral cortex is still
              incomplete. Here we demonstrate that at the beginning of
              corticogenesis, at embryonic 5 gestation weeks (gw, Carnegie
              stage 16) in human, early neurons could be labeled with
              calretinin, calbindin, and GABA antibodies. These immunolabeled
              cells show a gradient from the ganglionic eminences (GE) toward
              the neocortex, suggesting that GE is a well conserved source of
              early born cortical interneurons from rodents to human. At
              mid-term (20 gw), however, a subset of calretinin(+) cells
              proliferates in the cortical subventricular zone (SVZ),
              suggesting a second set of interneuron progenitors that have
              neocortical origin. Neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, or parvalbumin
              cells are sparse in mid-term cerebral cortex. In addition to the
              early source of cortical interneurons in the GE and later in the
              neocortical SVZ, other regions, such as the subpial granular
              layer, may also contribute to the population of human cortical
              interneurons. In conclusion, our findings from cryosections and
              previous in vitro results suggest that cortical interneuron
              progenitor population is more complex in humans relative to
              rodents. The increased complexity of progenitors is probably
              evolutionary adaptation necessary for development of the higher

               Cellular components and extracellular matrix (ECM) are the two
               primary sources of heterogeneity in GBM. Here, biomimetic
               tri-regional GBM models with tumor regions, acellular ECM
               regions, and an endothelial region with regional stiffnesses
               patterned corresponding to the GBM stroma, pathological or
               normal brain parenchyma, and brain capillaries, are developed.
               Patient-derived GBM cells, human endothelial cells, and
               hyaluronic acid derivatives are used to generate a
               species-matched and biochemically relevant microenvironment.
               This in vitro study demonstrates that biophysical cues are
               involved in various tumor cell behaviors and angiogenic
               potentials and promote different molecular subtypes of GBM. The

               Meanwhile, the soft models demonstrate enrichment in the
               classical subtype and support expansive cell growth. The

               primarily on associative data between observed changes in DNA
               methylation states and local changes in transcriptional activity

              physiology. How RAR-mediated regulation is achieved is poorly

              target genes in the brain. Also, it is not clear how reduced RA

              neuropsychiatric disorders. We report the first genome-wide
              analysis of RAR transcriptional targets in the brain. Using
              chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput
              sequencing and transcriptomic analysis of RAR$\beta$-null mutant
              mice, we identified genomic targets of RAR$\beta$ in the
              striatum. Characterization of RAR$\beta$ transcriptional targets
              in the mouse striatum points to mechanisms through which RAR may
              control brain functions and display neuroprotective activity.
              Namely, our data indicate with statistical significance (FDR 0.1)
              a strong contribution of RAR$\beta$ in controlling
              neurotransmission, energy metabolism, and transcription, with a
              particular involvement of G-protein coupled receptor (p =
              5.0e-5), cAMP (p = 4.5e-4), and calcium signaling (p = 3.4e-3).
              Many identified RAR$\beta$ target genes related to these pathways
              have been implicated in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and
              Huntington's disease (HD), raising the possibility that
              compromised RA signaling in the striatum may be a mechanistic
              link explaining the similar affective and cognitive symptoms in
              these diseases. The RAR$\beta$ transcriptional targets were
              particularly enriched for transcripts affected in HD. Using the
              R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD, we show that partial
              sequestration of RAR$\beta$ in huntingtin protein aggregates may

              regulating target genes through proximal promoters by forming
              enhancer-promoter interactions. Although recently developed
              high-throughput experimental approaches have allowed us to
              recognize potential enhancer-promoter interactions genome-wide,
              it is still largely unclear to what extent the sequence-level
              information encoded in our genome help guide such interactions.
              Methods: Here we report a new computational method (named
              ``SPEID'') using deep learning models to predict
              enhancer-promoter interactions based on sequence-based features
              only, when the locations of putative enhancers and promoters in a
              particular cell type are given. Results: Our results across six
              different cell types demonstrate that SPEID is effective in
              predicting enhancer-promoter interactions as compared to
              state-of-the-art methods that only use information from a single
              cell type. As a proof-of-principle, we also applied SPEID to
              identify somatic non-coding mutations in melanoma samples that
              may have reduced enhancer-promoter interactions in tumor genomes.
              Conclusions: This work demonstrates that deep learning models can
              help reveal that sequence-based features alone are sufficient to
              reliably predict enhancer-promoter interactions genome-wide.",

               classically felt to be a part of the hippocampus (HC). In the
               mouse, IG lies just dorsal to the corpus callosum at the base of
               the anterior half of cingulate cortex. In coronal sections the
               field is small but constitutes a fairly long rostro-caudal
               strip. The connections of the IG are poorly understood. The
               Timm's staining pattern of the IG is reminiscent of a
               mini-dentate gyrus (DG) comprising a layer of granule cells with
               two bands of staining in the molecular layer. In the DG there
               are three bands which correspond to inputs from the lateral and
               medial entorhinal area (LEA and MEA) and the ipsi- and
               contralateral association systems. Using anterograde transport
               of HRP we have found that the LEA and MEA also terminate in the
               molecular layer of the IG. This suggests that the IG is a
               displaced portion of the DG. The olfactory system is known to
               have a strong indirect influence on the HC via primary and
               secondary bulbar projections to the LEA. Wheat germ
               agglutinin-HRP injections confined to the main olfactory bulb
               (MOB) show a direct projection from the MOB to IG. Both the
               olfactory bulb itself and retrobulbar structures such as the
               piriform cortex (PC) convey olfactory information to the LEA;
               the LEA supplies a major input to the DG. Our results suggest
               that there is a more direct pathway whereby olfactory
               information may influence a cortical region, IG, whose
               histochemistry and direct afferents from the entorhinal cortex
               suggest that it is part of or closely related to the DG. Thus,

               methylation is associated with histone modifications and the
               interplay of these epigenetic modifications is crucial to
               regulate the functioning of the genome by changing chromatin
               architecture. The covalent addition of a methyl group occurs
               generally in cytosine within CpG dinucleotides which are
               concentrated in large clusters called CpG islands. DNA
               methyltransferases are responsible for establishing and
               maintenance of methylation pattern. It is commonly known that
               inactivation of certain tumor-suppressor genes occurs as a
               consequence of hypermethylation within the promoter regions and
               a numerous studies have demonstrated a broad range of genes
               silenced by DNA methylation in different cancer types. On the
               other hand, global hypomethylation, inducing genomic
               instability, also contributes to cell transformation. Apart from
               DNA methylation alterations in promoter regions and repetitive
               DNA sequences, this phenomenon is associated also with
               regulation of expression of noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs
               that may play role in tumor suppression. DNA methylation seems
               to be promising in putative translational use in patients and
               hypermethylated promoters may serve as biomarkers. Moreover,
               unlike genetic alterations, DNA methylation is reversible what
               makes it extremely interesting for therapy approaches. The
               importance of DNA methylation alterations in tumorigenesis
               encourages us to decode the human epigenome. Different DNA
               methylome mapping techniques are indispensable to realize this
               project in the future.",

  abstract  = "The mammalian claustrum is a pallial nucleus embedded in the
               telencephalic white matter under the insula. It is a
               Cinderella-like anatomic entity, which is not well understood in
               many ways, but whose constancy suggests it performs an essential
               function. This embryological essay first discusses in detail the
               diverse historic conceptions about how it develops, pointing out
               both critical data obtained and faulty assumptions that led to
               erroneous conclusions. Five successive models have been produced
               about the origin of the claustrum. Initial debates considered
               whether the claustrum is pallial or subpallial, finally
               establishing its pallial nature. It was also discussed whether
               it delaminates from the insular cortex next to it or arises
               independently from an adjacent pallial progenitor area that also
               produces the olfactory cortex. The non-insular source was
               eventually held to be subdivided in two parallel domains with
               distinct properties (and several parts of claustrum),
               consistently with observations in birds and reptiles. In
               contrast, comparative studies in basal mammals suggested that
               the claustrum is hidden or partly hidden inside the insular
               cortex (particularly in monotremes, where at first it was said
               not to exist). Claustral parts therefore may be understood as
               internal cortical elements. Neurogenetic studies indicated that
               claustral neurons are among the earliest cells to be born in the
               pallium. Modern results with gene mapping methods are examined
               next. These tended to corroborate a tetrapartite pallium model,
               with a non-insular claustrum origin in ventral and lateral
               pallium. However, some predictions have not been verified. Very
               recent reexamination in the mouse of claustral development,
               using the gene Nr4a2 as a characteristic marker, corroborated
               its early origin and its intimate association with insular
               cortex via a shared packet of radial glial fibers. Insular
               neurons are born after the claustrum is present subpially, and
               migrate across it to form the insular cortical plate, in so
               doing pushing the claustrum into the depths. The concept of
               ``lateral pallium'' was thus redefined as a claustro-insular and
               claustro-rhinal, longitudinal histogenetic unit wholly parallel
               to olfactory cortex. It does not enter the amygdala. Various
               interesting examples of pallio-pallial migration could be traced
               from the claustral primordium into neighboring pallial domains,
               and in particular the precocious subplate cells. The ``ventral
               pallium'' concept was also redefined, since the olfactory cortex
               is now wholly ascribed to it. The insula is no longer considered
               to be part of the ``dorsal pallium'' or neocortex. These
               novelties imply a modified tetrapartite pallium model, which
               gives new insights about comparative analysis of claustral and
               cortical evolution.",

              Here, we demonstrate strong and widespread coupling between genic
              LoF intolerance and promoter CpG density across the human genome.
              Genes downstream of the most CpG-rich promoters (top 10\% CpG
              density) have a 67.2\% probability of being highly LoF
              intolerant, using the LOEUF metric from gnomAD. This is in
              contrast to 7.4\% of genes downstream of the most CpG-poor
              (bottom 10\% CpG density) promoters. Combining promoter CpG
              density with exonic and promoter conservation explains 33.4\% of
              the variation in LOEUF, and the contribution of CpG density
              exceeds the individual contributions of exonic and promoter
              conservation. We leverage this to train a simple and easily

              epidemiological findings, a number of translational rodent models
              have been established to explore the consequences of prenatal
              immune activation on brain and behavioral development. The
              currently existing models are based on maternal gestational
              exposure to human influenza virus, the viral mimic
              polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid [Poly(I:C)], the
              bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, the locally acting
              inflammatory agent turpentine, or selected inflammatory
              cytokines. These models are pivotal for establishing causal
              relationships and for identifying cellular and molecular
              mechanisms that affect normal brain development in the event of
              early-life immune exposures. An important aspect of developmental
              immune activation models is that they allow a multi-faceted,
              longitudinal monitoring of the disease process as it unfolds
              during the course of neurodevelopment from prenatal to adult
              stages of life. An important recent refinement of these models is
              the incorporation of multiple etiologically relevant risk factors
              by combining prenatal immune challenges with specific genetic
              manipulations or additional environmental adversities. Converging

              infection might reflect an early entry into the neuropsychiatric
              route, but the specificity of subsequent disease or symptoms is
              likely to be strongly influenced by the genetic and environmental

              family members have proved to be versatile and powerful
              components of the molecular machinery that executes the blueprint
              of embryogenesis across vertebrate and invertebrate species.
              Here, we focus on the spatio-temporally varied functions of
              LIM-homeodomain transcription factor LHX2 in the developing mouse
              forebrain. Right from its earliest known role in telencephalic
              and eye field patterning, to the control of the neuron-glia cell
              fate switch, and the regulation of axon pathfinding and dendritic
              arborization in late embryonic stages, LHX2 has been identified
              as a fundamental, temporally dynamic, always necessary, and often
              sufficient factor in a range of critical developmental phenomena.
              While Lhx2 mutant phenotypes have been characterized in detail in
              multiple brain structures, only recently have we advanced in our
              understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which this factor
              acts. Common themes emerge from how this multifunctional molecule
              controls a range of developmental steps in distinct forebrain
              structures. Examining these shared features, and noting unique
              aspects of LHX2 function is likely to inform our understanding of
              how a single factor can bring about a diversity of effects and
              play central and critical roles across systems and stages. The
              parallels in LHX2 and APTEROUS functions, and the protein

  abstract  = "Substantial evidence indicates that the lateral septum (LS)
               plays a critical role in regulating processes related to mood
               and motivation. This review presents findings from the basic
               neuroscience literature and from some clinically oriented
               research, drawing from behavioral, neuroanatomical,
               electrophysiological, and molecular studies in support of such a
               role, and articulates models and hypotheses intended to advance
               our understanding of these functions. Neuroanatomically, the LS
               is connected with numerous regions known to regulate affect,
               such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Through its
               connections with the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, the LS
               regulates motivation, both by stimulating the activity of
               midbrain dopamine neurons and regulating the consequences of
               this activity on the ventral striatum. Evidence that LS function
               could impact processes related to schizophrenia and other
               psychotic spectrum disorders, such as alterations in LS function
               following administration of antipsychotics and psychotomimetics
               in animals, will also be presented. The LS can also diminish or
               enable fear responding when its neural activity is stimulated or
               inhibited, respectively, perhaps through its projections to the
               hypothalamus. It also regulates behavioral manifestations of
               depression, with antidepressants stimulating the activity of LS
               neurons, and depression-like phenotypes corresponding to blunted
               activity of LS neurons; serotonin likely plays a key role in
               modulating these functions by influencing the responsiveness of
               the LS to hippocampal input. In conclusion, a better
               understanding of the LS may provide important and useful
               information in the pursuit of better treatments for a wide range

              preferential loss of expression of super-enhancer-associated

              causation is most directly addressable in genetically tractable

              states. These emotion states exhibit certain general functional
              and adaptive properties that apply across any specific human

              measurements from multiple experiments and biological contexts.
              To flexibly model single-cell datasets, we developed LIGER, an
              algorithm that delineates shared and dataset-specific features of
              cell identity. We applied it to four diverse and challenging
              analyses of human and mouse brain cells. First, we defined
              region-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression in the
              mouse bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Second, we analyzed
              expression in the human substantia nigra, comparing cell states
              in specific donors and relating cell types to those in the mouse.
              Third, we integrated in situ and single-cell expression data to
              spatially locate fine subtypes of cells present in the mouse
              frontal cortex. Finally, we jointly defined mouse cortical cell
              types using single-cell RNA-seq and DNA methylation profiles,
              revealing putative mechanisms of cell-type-specific epigenomic
              regulation. Integrative analyses using LIGER promise to

               functions. Our understanding of 3D genome organization requires
               tools to directly visualize chromatin conformation in its native
               context. Here we report an imaging technology for visualizing
               chromatin organization across multiple scales in single cells
               with high genomic throughput. First we demonstrate multiplexed
               imaging of hundreds of genomic loci by sequential hybridization,
               which allows high-resolution conformation tracing of whole
               chromosomes. Next we report a multiplexed error-robust
               fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH)-based method for
               genome-scale chromatin tracing and demonstrate simultaneous
               imaging of more than 1,000 genomic loci and nascent transcripts
               of more than 1,000 genes together with landmark nuclear
               structures. Using this technology, we characterize chromatin
               domains, compartments, and trans-chromosomal interactions and
               their relationship to transcription in single cells. We envision
               broad application of this high-throughput, multi-scale, and

               To better constrain the definition of neuronal cell types, we
               characterized the transcriptomes and intrinsic physiological
               properties of over 4,200 mouse visual cortical GABAergic
               interneurons and reconstructed the local morphologies of 517 of
               those neurons. We find that most transcriptomic types (t-types)
               occupy specific laminar positions within visual cortex, and, for
               most types, the cells mapping to a t-type exhibit consistent

              bifurcations characterize the commitment of early specialized

              progenitors the differential expression of transcription factors
              that specify their area identity, which is inherited by their
              neuronal progeny, providing the genetic framework for area
              patterning. The two patterning centers most directly implicated
              in arealization are the commissural plate, which expresses
              fibroblast growth factors, and the cortical hem, which expresses
              bone morphogenetic proteins and vertebrate orthologs of
              Drosophila wingless, the Wnts. A third, albeit putative,
              patterning center is the antihem, identified by its expression of
              multiple signaling molecules. We describe recent findings on
              roles for these patterning centers in arealization. We also
              present the most recent evidence on functions of the four

              candidate target genes of these transcription factors, or other
              genes potentially involved in arealization. We conclude with an
              assessment of a forward genetics approach for identifying genes
              involved in determining area size based in part on quantitative
              trait locus mapping, and the implications for significant

              enables more accurate lineage reconstruction of larger trees.

              enhancers that can be located in remote positions, including the
              introns of neighboring genes [1]. They nonetheless produce
              patterns of gene expression that are the same as or similar to
              those produced by more proximal primary enhancers. It was
              suggested that shadow enhancers help foster robustness in gene
              expression in response to environmental or genetic perturbations
              [2, 3]. We critically tested this hypothesis by employing a
              combination of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
              recombineering and quantitative confocal imaging methods [2, 4].
              Evidence is presented that the snail gene is regulated by a
              distal shadow enhancer located within a neighboring locus.
              Removal of the proximal primary enhancer does not significantly
              perturb snail function, including the repression of neurogenic
              genes and formation of the ventral furrow during gastrulation at

              sporadic loss of snail expression and coincident disruptions in

              Such robustness is thought to be conferred, in part, through
              elements within regulatory networks that perform similar,
              redundant tasks. Redundant enhancers (or ``shadow'' enhancers),
              for example, can confer precision and robustness to gene
              expression, at least at individual, well-studied loci. However,
              the extent to which enhancer redundancy exists and can thereby
              have a major impact on developmental robustness remains unknown.
              Here, we systematically assessed this, identifying over 1,000
              predicted shadow enhancers during Drosophila mesoderm
              development. The activity of 23 elements, associated with five
              genes, was examined in transgenic embryos, while natural
              structural variation among individuals was used to assess their
              ability to buffer against genetic variation. Our results reveal
              three clear properties of enhancer redundancy within
              developmental systems. First, it is much more pervasive than
              previously anticipated, with 64\% of loci examined having shadow
              enhancers. Their spatial redundancy is often partial in nature,
              while the non-overlapping function may explain why these
              enhancers are maintained within a population. Second, over 70\%
              of loci do not follow the simple situation of having only two
              shadow enhancers-often there are three (rols), four (CadN and
              ade5), or five (Traf1), at least one of which can be deleted with
              no obvious phenotypic effects. Third, although shadow enhancers
              can buffer variation, patterns of segregating variation suggest
              that they play a more complex role in development than generally
              considered.",

               5-carboxycytosine (5caC). Although these bases are known to
               contribute to distinct demethylation pathways, the lack of tools

              outputs of the rod and cone photoreceptors into ∼12 parallel
              information streams. The second connects these streams to
              specific types of retinal ganglion cells. The third combines
              bipolar and amacrine cell activity to create the diverse
              encodings of the visual world--roughly 20 of them--that the
              retina transmits to the brain. New transformations of the visual
              input continue to be found: at least half of the encodings sent
              to the brain (ganglion cell response selectivities) remain to be

              NKX2-1 binding at distal regulatory elements led to a repressed

              epidemiological studies, a great deal of recent interest has been
              centered upon the establishment of neurodevelopmental rodent
              models in which the basic experimental manipulation takes the
              form of prenatal exposure to infection and/or immune activation.
              One such model is based on prenatal treatment with the
              inflammatory agent poly(I:C) (=polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic
              acid), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA. Since its
              initial establishment and application to basic schizophrenia
              research, the poly(I:C) model has made a great impact on
              researchers concentrating on the neurodevelopmental and
              neuroimmunological basis of complex human brain disorders such as
              schizophrenia, and as a consequence, the model now enjoys wide
              recognition in the international scientific community. The
              present article emphasizes that the poly(I:C) model has gained
              such impact because it successfully accounts for several aspects
              of schizophrenia epidemiology, pathophysiology, symptomatology,
              and treatment. The numerous features of this experimental system
              make the poly(I:C) model a very powerful neurodevelopmental
              animal model of schizophrenia-relevant brain disease which is
              expected to be capable of critically advancing our knowledge of

              has gained widespread acceptance. Neuroblasts from the
              subventricular zone (SVZ) migrate along the rostral migratory
              stream (RMS) into the olfactory bulb, where they differentiate
              into interneurons. Neuroblasts from the subgranular zone (SGZ) of
              the hippocampal formation show relatively little migratory
              behavior, and differentiate into dentate gyrus granule cells. In
              sharp contrast to embryonic and perinatal development, these
              newly differentiated neurons must integrate into a fully
              functional circuit, without disrupting ongoing performance. Here,
              after a brief historical overview and introduction to olfactory
              circuitry, we review recent advances in the biology of neural
              stem cells, mechanisms of migration in the RMS and olfactory
              bulb, differentiation and survival of new neurons, and finally
              mechanisms of synaptic integration. Our primary focus is on the
              olfactory system, but we also contrast the events occurring there
              with those in the hippocampal formation. Although both SVZ and
              SGZ neurogenesis are involved in some types of learning, their

              spontaneous 'epimutations' occur at a rate that is 100 000 times
              higher than the genetic mutation rate, are effectively neutral at

              Behaviorally, a distinction between dorsolateral and ventromedial
              seems most valid, in accordance with a mediolateral functional
              zonation imposed on the striatum by its excitatory cortical,

              studies of complexity and evolution. However, as with other units
              of evolution, the cell type often resists definition. This review
              proposes guidelines for characterising cell types and discusses
              cell homology and the various developmental pathways by which
              cell types arise, including germ layers, blastemata (secondary
              development/neurulation), stem cells, and transdifferentiation.
              An updated list of cell types is presented for a familiar, albeit
              overlooked model taxon, adult Homo sapiens, with 411 cell types,
              including 145 types of neurons, recognised. Two methods for
              organising these cell types are explored. One is the artificial
              classification technique, clustering cells using commonly
              accepted criteria of similarity. The second approach, an
              empirical method modeled after cladistics, resolves the
              classification in terms of shared features rather than overall
              similarity. While the results of each scheme differ, both methods
              address important questions. The artificial classification
              provides compelling (and independent) support for the neural
              crest as the fourth germ layer, while the cladistic approach
              permits the evaluation of cell type evolution. Using the
              cladistic approach we observe a correlation between the
              developmental and evolutionary origin of a cell, suggesting that
              this method is useful for predicting which cell types share
              common (multipotential) progenitors. Whereas the current effort
              is restricted by the availability of phenotypic details for most
              cell types, the present study demonstrates that a comprehensive
              cladistic classification is practical, attainable, and warranted.
              The use of cell types and cell type comparative classification

              mammalian de novo DNA methyltransferases in vitro and the extent
              to which this applies in cells. In a biochemical experiment, we
              subjected a wide variety of DNA sequences to methylation by
              DNMT3A or DNMT3B and then applied deep bisulfite sequencing to
              quantitatively determine the sequence preferences for
              methylation. The data show that DNMT3A prefers CpG and non-CpG
              sites followed by a 3'-pyrimidine, whereas DNMT3B favors a
              3'-purine. Overall, we show that DNMT3A has a sequence preference

              Furthermore, loss of DNMT3A or DNMT3B in human embryonic stem

              mental retardation in females, with an incidence of 1 in
              10,000-15,000 (ref. 2). Patients with classic RTT appear to
              develop normally until 6-18 months of age, then gradually lose
              speech and purposeful hand use, and develop microcephaly,

              stereotypic hand movements. After initial regression, the
              condition stabilizes and patients usually survive into adulthood.
              As RTT occurs almost exclusively in females, it has been proposed
              that RTT is caused by an X-linked dominant mutation with
              lethality in hemizygous males. Previous exclusion mapping studies
              using RTT families mapped the locus to Xq28 (refs 6,9,10,11).
              Using a systematic gene screening approach, we have identified
              mutations in the gene (MECP2 ) encoding X-linked
              methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) as the cause of some cases
              of RTT. MeCP2 selectively binds CpG dinucleotides in the

              interaction with histone deacetylase and the corepressor SIN3A
              (refs 12,13). In 5 of 21 sporadic patients, we found 3 de novo

              methyl-binding domain (MBD) as well as a de novo frameshift and a
              de novo nonsense mutation, both of which disrupt the
              transcription repression domain (TRD). In two affected
              half-sisters of a RTT family, we found segregation of an
              additional missense mutation not detected in their obligate
              carrier mother. This suggests that the mother is a germline
              mosaic for this mutation. Our study reports the first
              disease-causing mutations in RTT and points to abnormal

  abstract  = "The expression of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) and
               H19 genes is imprinted. Although these neighbouring genes share
               an enhancer, H19 is expressed only from the maternal allele, and
               Igf2 only from the paternally inherited allele. A region of
               paternal-specific methylation upstream of H19 appears to be the
               site of an epigenetic mark that is required for the imprinting
               of these genes. A deletion within this region results in loss of
               imprinting of both H19 and Igf2 (ref. 5). Here we show that this
               methylated region contains an element that blocks enhancer
               activity. The activity of this element is dependent upon the
               vertebrate enhancer-blocking protein CTCF. Methylation of CpGs
               within the CTCF-binding sites eliminates binding of CTCF in
               vitro, and deletion of these sites results in loss of
               enhancer-blocking activity in vivo, thereby allowing gene
               expression. This CTCF-dependent enhancer-blocking element acts
               as an insulator. We suggest that it controls imprinting of Igf2.
               The activity of this insulator is restricted to the maternal
               allele by specific DNA methylation of the paternal allele. Our
               results reveal that DNA methylation can control gene expression
               by modulating enhancer access to the gene promoter through
               regulation of an enhancer boundary.",

              125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The

              duplications, giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral
              gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid.
              The genome contains 25,498 genes encoding proteins from 11,000

              rule. Radial glia are generated before neurogenesis and guide
              neuronal migration. Radial glia are mitotically active throughout

              epigenome sequencing in an individual cell has not yet been
              achieved. Here, we developed a single-cell multi-omics sequencing
              technology (single-cell COOL-seq) that can analyze the chromatin
              state/nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, copy number
              variation and ploidy simultaneously from the same individual
              mammalian cell. We used this method to analyze the reprogramming
              of the chromatin state and DNA methylation in mouse
              preimplantation embryos. We found that within < 12 h of
              fertilization, each individual cell undergoes global genome
              demethylation together with the rapid and global reprogramming of
              both maternal and paternal genomes to a highly opened chromatin
              state. This was followed by decreased openness after the late
              zygote stage. Furthermore, from the late zygote to the 4-cell
              stage, the residual DNA methylation is preferentially preserved
              on intergenic regions of the paternal alleles and intragenic
              regions of maternal alleles in each individual blastomere.
              However, chromatin accessibility is similar between paternal and
              maternal alleles in each individual cell from the late zygote to
              the blastocyst stage. The binding motifs of several pluripotency
              regulators are enriched at distal nucleosome depleted regions
              from as early as the 2-cell stage. This indicates that the
              cis-regulatory elements of such target genes have been primed to
              an open state from the 2-cell stage onward, long before
              pluripotency is eventually established in the ICM of the
              blastocyst. Genes may be classified into homogeneously open,
              homogeneously closed and divergent states based on the chromatin
              accessibility of their promoter regions among individual cells.
              This can be traced to step-wise transitions during
              preimplantation development. Our study offers the first
              single-cell and parental allele-specific analysis of the
              genome-scale chromatin state and DNA methylation dynamics at
              single-base resolution in early mouse embryos and provides new

              regulatory code by binding to specific sequences to induce or

              used to identify potential cis-regulatory sequences within the

              information alone does not reveal if or when transcriptional

              initial map of yeast's transcriptional regulatory code by
              identifying the sequence elements that are bound by regulators
              under various conditions and that are conserved among

              promoters and the environment-dependent use of these elements by
              regulators are discussed. We find that environment-specific use

              methylation (5-methylcytosine) has a profound impact on chromatin
              structure, gene expression and maintenance of cellular identity.
              The recent demonstration that members of the Ten-eleven
              translocation (Tet) family of proteins can convert
              5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine raised the
              possibility that Tet proteins are capable of establishing a
              distinct epigenetic state. We have recently demonstrated that
              Tet1 is specifically expressed in murine embryonic stem (ES)
              cells and is required for ES cell maintenance. Using chromatin
              immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput DNA sequencing,
              here we show in mouse ES cells that Tet1 is preferentially bound
              to CpG-rich sequences at promoters of both transcriptionally
              active and Polycomb-repressed genes. Despite an increase in
              levels of DNA methylation at many Tet1-binding sites, Tet1
              depletion does not lead to downregulation of all the Tet1
              targets. Interestingly, although Tet1-mediated promoter
              hypomethylation is required for maintaining the expression of a
              group of transcriptionally active genes, it is also involved in
              repression of Polycomb-targeted developmental regulators. Tet1
              contributes to silencing of this group of genes by facilitating
              recruitment of PRC2 to CpG-rich gene promoters. Thus, our study
              not only establishes a role for Tet1 in modulating DNA
              methylation levels at CpG-rich promoters, but also reveals a dual
              function of Tet1 in promoting transcription of pluripotency

  abstract  = "5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a modified base present at low
               levels in diverse cell types in mammals. 5hmC is generated by
               the TET family of Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes
               through oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC). 5hmC and TET
               proteins have been implicated in stem cell biology and cancer,
               but information on the genome-wide distribution of 5hmC is
               limited. Here we describe two novel and specific approaches to
               profile the genomic localization of 5hmC. The first approach,
               termed GLIB (glucosylation, periodate oxidation, biotinylation)
               uses a combination of enzymatic and chemical steps to isolate
               DNA fragments containing as few as a single 5hmC. The second
               approach involves conversion of 5hmC to cytosine
               5-methylenesulphonate (CMS) by treatment of genomic DNA with
               sodium bisulphite, followed by immunoprecipitation of
               CMS-containing DNA with a specific antiserum to CMS.
               High-throughput sequencing of 5hmC-containing DNA from mouse
               embryonic stem (ES) cells showed strong enrichment within exons
               and near transcriptional start sites. 5hmC was especially
               enriched at the start sites of genes whose promoters bear dual
               histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and histone 3
               lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks. Our results indicate
               that 5hmC has a probable role in transcriptional regulation, and
               suggest a model in which 5hmC contributes to the 'poised'
               chromatin signature found at developmentally-regulated genes in
               ES cells.",

              astrocyte-conditioned medium significantly reduces its ability to

              a properly regenerated tissue are not well understood. Using a
              new, non-invasive, intravital two-photon imaging approach we
              study physiological hair-follicle regeneration over time in live
              mice. By these means we have monitored the behaviour of
              epithelial stem cells and their progeny during physiological hair
              regeneration and addressed how the mesenchyme influences their
              behaviour. Consistent with earlier studies, stem cells are
              quiescent during the initial stages of hair regeneration, whereas
              the progeny are more actively dividing. Moreover, stem cell
              progeny divisions are spatially organized within follicles. In
              addition to cell divisions, coordinated cell movements of the
              progeny allow the rapid expansion of the hair follicle. Finally,
              we show the requirement of the mesenchyme for hair regeneration
              through targeted cell ablation and long-term tracking of live
              hair follicles. Thus, we have established an in vivo approach
              that has led to the direct observation of cellular mechanisms of
              growth regulation within the hair follicle and that has enabled
              us to precisely investigate functional requirements of
              hair-follicle components during the process of physiological
              regeneration.",

              diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human
              transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic
              binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over

              regulation for only 21.8\% of autosomal CpGs within a normal
              developmental context, most of which are distal to transcription
              start sites. These dynamic CpGs co-localize with gene regulatory

               contrast with the events of fertilization, during which the

               These dynamics have been extensively characterized in the mouse,

               direct measurements are required to understand the extent to

               Retrotransposon regulation is also highly diverse, and
               transitions from maternally to embryonically expressed elements.

               essential for various developmental processes through regulating
               gene expression, genomic imprinting, and epigenetic inheritance.
               Mammalian genomic DNA methylation is established during
               embryogenesis by de novo DNA methyltransferases, DNMT3A and
               DNMT3B, and the methylation patterns vary with developmental
               stages and cell types. DNA methyltransferase 3-like protein
               (DNMT3L) is a catalytically inactive paralogue of DNMT3 enzymes,
               which stimulates the enzymatic activity of Dnmt3a. Recent
               studies have established a connection between DNA methylation
               and histone modifications, and revealed a histone-guided
               mechanism for the establishment of DNA methylation. The
               ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L (ADD) domain of Dnmt3a recognizes unmethylated
               histone H3 (H3K4me0). The histone H3 tail stimulates the
               enzymatic activity of Dnmt3a in vitro, whereas the molecular
               mechanism remains elusive. Here we show that DNMT3A exists in an
               autoinhibitory form and that the histone H3 tail stimulates its
               activity in a DNMT3L-independent manner. We determine the
               crystal structures of DNMT3A-DNMT3L (autoinhibitory form) and
               DNMT3A-DNMT3L-H3 (active form) complexes at 3.82 and 2.90 {\AA}
               resolution, respectively. Structural and biochemical analyses
               indicate that the ADD domain of DNMT3A interacts with and
               inhibits enzymatic activity of the catalytic domain (CD) through
               blocking its DNA-binding affinity. Histone H3 (but not H3K4me3)
               disrupts ADD-CD interaction, induces a large movement of the ADD
               domain, and thus releases the autoinhibition of DNMT3A. The
               finding adds another layer of regulation of DNA methylation to
               ensure that the enzyme is mainly activated at proper targeting
               loci when unmethylated H3K4 is present, and strongly supports a
               negative correlation between H3K4me3 and DNA methylation across
               the mammalian genome. Our study provides a new insight into an
               unexpected autoinhibition and histone H3-induced activation of
               the de novo DNA methyltransferase after its initial genomic

              splicing and premature termination. Dense methylation near the
              Karma splice site (termed the Good Karma epiallele) predicts
              normal fruit set, whereas hypomethylation (the Bad Karma
              epiallele) predicts homeotic transformation, parthenocarpy and
              marked loss of yield. Loss of Karma methylation and of small RNA
              in tissue culture contributes to the origin of mantled, while
              restoration in spontaneous revertants accounts for non-Mendelian
              inheritance. The ability to predict and cull mantling at the

              between DNA-bound TFs have not been systematically characterized.
              To identify TF pairs that bind cooperatively to DNA, and to
              characterize their spacing and orientation preferences, we have
              performed consecutive affinity-purification systematic evolution
              of ligands by exponential enrichment (CAP-SELEX) analysis of
              9,400 TF-TF-DNA interactions. This analysis revealed 315 TF-TF

              markedly different from the individual TF's motifs. Together, our

               Chromatin has the potential to restrict accessibility of binding
               sites; however, in which context chromatin states are
               instructive for TF binding remains mainly unknown. To explore
               the contribution of DNA methylation to constrained TF binding,
               we mapped DNase-I-hypersensitive sites in murine stem cells in
               the presence and absence of DNA methylation.
               Methylation-restricted sites are enriched for TF motifs
               containing CpGs, especially for those of NRF1. In fact, the TF
               NRF1 occupies several thousand additional sites in the
               unmethylated genome, resulting in increased transcription.
               Restoring de novo methyltransferase activity initiates
               remethylation at these sites and outcompetes NRF1 binding. This
               suggests that binding of DNA-methylation-sensitive TFs relies on
               additional determinants to induce local hypomethylation. In
               support of this model, removal of neighbouring motifs in cis or
               of a TF in trans causes local hypermethylation and subsequent
               loss of NRF1 binding. This competition between DNA methylation
               and TFs in vivo reveals a case of cooperativity between TFs that
               acts indirectly via DNA methylation. Methylation removal by
               methylation-insensitive factors enables occupancy of

               which interferes with iron-dependent hydroxylases, including the
               TET family of 5'-methylcytosine hydroxylases. TET enzymes
               catalyse a key step in the removal of DNA methylation. IDH

               (G-CIMP), although the functional importance of this altered

              DNA base into another in a programmable manner, without requiring

              genes has yet to be clarified. Here we show that, in mouse

              protein 2 (MeCP2) protein is an epigenetic reader whose binding
              to chromatin primarily depends on 5-methylcytosine. Functionally,
              MeCP2 has been implicated in several cellular processes on the
              basis of its reported interaction with more than 40 binding
              partners, including transcriptional co-repressors (for example,
              the NCoR/SMRT complex), transcriptional activators, RNA,
              chromatin remodellers, microRNA-processing proteins and splicing
              factors. Accordingly, MeCP2 has been cast as a multi-functional
              hub that integrates diverse processes that are essential in
              mature neurons. At odds with the concept of broad functionality,
              missense mutations that cause Rett syndrome are concentrated in
              two discrete clusters coinciding with interaction sites for
              partner macromolecules: the methyl-CpG binding domain and the
              NCoR/SMRT interaction domain. Here we test the hypothesis that
              the single dominant function of MeCP2 is to physically connect
              DNA with the NCoR/SMRT complex, by removing almost all amino-acid
              sequences except the methyl-CpG binding and NCoR/SMRT interaction
              domains. We find that mice expressing truncated MeCP2 lacking
              both the N- and C-terminal regions (approximately half of the
              native protein) are phenotypically near-normal; and those
              expressing a minimal MeCP2 additionally lacking a central domain
              survive for over one year with only mild symptoms. This minimal
              protein is able to prevent or reverse neurological symptoms when
              introduced into MeCP2-deficient mice by genetic activation or
              virus-mediated delivery to the brain. Thus, despite evolutionary
              conservation of the entire MeCP2 protein sequence, the DNA and
              co-repressor binding domains alone are sufficient to avoid Rett
              syndrome-like defects and may therefore have therapeutic utility.",

              single and combinatorial enhancer deletions at seven distinct
              loci required for limb development. Unexpectedly, none of the ten
              deletions of individual enhancers caused noticeable changes in

              baseline expression of the target gene, even single enhancer
              deletions caused limb abnormalities, suggesting that functional
              redundancy is conferred by additive effects of enhancers on gene

              and transcriptomic data from 29 developmental mouse tissues

              multiple enhancers that have similar spatiotemporal activity.

  abstract = "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key parts of
              multiple cellular pathways, but their modes of action and how
              these are dictated by sequence remain unclear. lncRNAs tend to be
              enriched in the nuclear fraction, whereas most mRNAs are overtly
              cytoplasmic, although several studies have found that hundreds of
              mRNAs in various cell types are retained in the nucleus. It is
              thus conceivable that some mechanisms that promote nuclear
              enrichment are shared between lncRNAs and mRNAs. Here, to
              identify elements in lncRNAs and mRNAs that can force nuclear
              localization, we screened libraries of short fragments tiled
              across nuclear RNAs, which were cloned into the untranslated
              regions of an efficiently exported mRNA. The screen identified a
              short sequence derived from Alu elements and bound by HNRNPK that
              increased nuclear accumulation. Binding of HNRNPK to C-rich
              motifs outside Alu elements is also associated with nuclear
              enrichment in both lncRNAs and mRNAs, and this mechanism is
              conserved across species. Our results thus identify a pathway for
              regulation of RNA accumulation and subcellular localization that
              has been co-opted to regulate the fate of transcripts with
              integrated Alu elements.",

              multicellular organism, during which limited sets of embryonic
              progenitors produce all cells in the adult body. Determining
              which fate these progenitors acquire in adult tissues requires
              the simultaneous measurement of clonal history and cell identity
              at single-cell resolution, which has been a major challenge.
              Clonal history has traditionally been investigated by
              microscopically tracking cells during development, monitoring the
              heritable expression of genetically encoded fluorescent proteins
              and, more recently, using next-generation sequencing technologies
              that exploit somatic mutations, microsatellite instability,
              transposon tagging, viral barcoding, CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing
              and Cre-loxP recombination. Single-cell transcriptomics provides
              a powerful platform for unbiased cell-type classification. Here
              we present ScarTrace, a single-cell sequencing strategy that
              enables the simultaneous quantification of clonal history and
              cell type for thousands of cells obtained from different organs
              of the adult zebrafish. Using ScarTrace, we show that a small set
              of multipotent embryonic progenitors generate all haematopoietic
              cells in the kidney marrow, and that many progenitors produce
              specific cell types in the eyes and brain. In addition, we study
              when embryonic progenitors commit to the left or right eye.
              ScarTrace reveals that epidermal and mesenchymal cells in the
              caudal fin arise from the same progenitors, and that
              osteoblast-restricted precursors can produce mesenchymal cells
              during regeneration. Furthermore, we identify resident immune
              cells in the fin with a distinct clonal origin from other blood

              applications in other experimental systems, in which the matching
              of embryonic clonal origin to adult cell type will ultimately
              allow reconstruction of how the adult body is built from a single

              neurodevelopmental disorders; there is therefore a need for
              detailed knowledge of the development of the prefrontal cortex.
              However, it is still difficult to identify cell types in the
              developing human prefrontal cortex and to distinguish their

              the potential to illuminate the causal underpinnings of complex

              reconstructs regulatory landscapes from diverse features along

              enhancer-promoter interactions across multiple cell lines with a
              false discovery rate up to 15 times smaller than that obtained
              using the closest gene. By evaluating the genomic features
              driving this accuracy, we uncover interactions between structural
              proteins, transcription factors, epigenetic modifications, and
              transcription that together distinguish interacting from
              non-interacting enhancer-promoter pairs. Most of this signature

              However, the cellular heterogeneity of the brain impedes an

              rich new source of data for uncovering these subtypes but have
              proven difficult to compare, as two tumors rarely share the same
              mutations. Here we introduce network-based stratification (NBS),
              a method to integrate somatic tumor genomes with gene networks.
              This approach allows for stratification of cancer into
              informative subtypes by clustering together patients with
              mutations in similar network regions. We demonstrate NBS in
              ovarian, uterine and lung cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome
              Atlas. For each tissue, NBS identifies subtypes that are
              predictive of clinical outcomes such as patient survival,
              response to therapy or tumor histology. We identify network
              regions characteristic of each subtype and show how
              mutation-derived subtypes can be used to train an mRNA expression
              signature, which provides similar information in the absence of

              2007The ability to profile transcription and chromatin binding in
              a cell-type-specific manner is a powerful aid to understanding
              cell-fate specification and cellular function in multicellular
              organisms. We recently developed targeted DamID (TaDa) to enable
              genome-wide, cell-type-specific profiling of DNA- and
              chromatin-binding proteins in vivo without cell isolation. As a
              protocol extension, this article describes substantial
              modifications to an existing protocol, and it offers additional
              applications. TaDa builds upon DamID, a technique for detecting
              genome-wide DNA-binding profiles of proteins, by coupling it with
              the GAL4 system in Drosophila to enable both temporal and spatial
              resolution. TaDa ensures that Dam-fusion proteins are expressed
              at very low levels, thus avoiding toxicity and potential
              artifacts from overexpression. The modifications to the core
              DamID technique presented here also increase the speed of sample
              processing and throughput, and adapt the method to
              next-generation sequencing technology. TaDa is robust,
              reproducible and highly sensitive. Compared with other methods
              for cell-type-specific profiling, the technique requires no
              cell-sorting, cross-linking or antisera, and binding profiles can
              be generated from as few as 10,000 total induced cells. By
              profiling the genome-wide binding of RNA polymerase II (Pol II),
              TaDa can also identify transcribed genes in a cell-type-specific
              manner. Here we describe a detailed protocol for carrying out
              TaDa experiments and preparing the material for next-generation
              sequencing. Although we developed TaDa in Drosophila, it should
              be easily adapted to other organisms with an inducible expression
              system. Once transgenic animals are obtained, the entire
              experimental procedure-from collecting tissue samples to
              generating sequencing libraries-can be accomplished within 5 d.",

              is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Nucleosomes at

              dimensions, most frequently performed using t-distributed
              stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). It excels at revealing
              local structure in high-dimensional data, but naive applications
              often suffer from severe shortcomings, e.g. the global structure
              of the data is not represented accurately. Here we describe how
              to circumvent such pitfalls, and develop a protocol for creating
              more faithful t-SNE visualisations. It includes PCA
              initialisation, a high learning rate, and multi-scale similarity
              kernels; for very large data sets, we additionally use
              exaggeration and downsampling-based initialisation. We use
              published single-cell RNA-seq data sets to demonstrate that this
              protocol yields superior results compared to the naive
              application of t-SNE.",

              Non-CpG methylation plays a critical regulatory role in cognitive
              function, which is mediated by the binding of MeCP2, the
              transcriptional regulator that when mutated causes Rett syndrome.

              animal lineages, revealing that non-CpG methylation is restricted
              to vertebrates. We discovered that in vertebrates, non-CpG

               shape the evolutionary course of cancer1. Chronic lymphocytic
               leukaemia (CLL) is a highly informative model for cancer
               evolution as it undergoes substantial genetic diversification
               and evolution after therapy2,3. The CLL epigenome is also an
               important disease-defining feature4,5, and growing populations
               of cells in CLL diversify by stochastic changes in DNA
               methylation known as epimutations6. However, previous studies
               using bulk sequencing methods to analyse the patterns of DNA
               methylation were unable to determine whether epimutations affect
               CLL populations homogeneously. Here, to measure the epimutation
               rate at single-cell resolution, we applied multiplexed
               single-cell reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing to B
               cells from healthy donors and patients with CLL. We observed
               that the common clonal origin of CLL results in a consistently
               increased epimutation rate, with low variability in the
               cell-to-cell epimutation rate. By contrast, variable epimutation
               rates across healthy B cells reflect diverse evolutionary ages
               across the trajectory of B cell differentiation, consistent with
               epimutations serving as a molecular clock. Heritable epimutation
               information allowed us to reconstruct lineages at
               high-resolution with single-cell data, and to apply this
               directly to patient samples. The CLL lineage tree shape revealed
               earlier branching and longer branch lengths than in normal B
               cells, reflecting rapid drift after the initial malignant
               transformation and a greater proliferative history. Integration
               of single-cell bisulfite sequencing analysis with single-cell
               transcriptomes and genotyping confirmed that genetic subclones
               mapped to distinct clades, as inferred solely on the basis of
               epimutation information. Finally, to examine potential lineage
               biases during therapy, we profiled serial samples during
               ibrutinib-associated lymphocytosis, and identified clades of
               cells that were preferentially expelled from the lymph node
               after treatment, marked by distinct transcriptional profiles.
               The single-cell integration of genetic, epigenetic and
               transcriptional information thus charts the lineage history of
               CLL and its evolution with therapy.",

              This has raised doubts as to whether developmental processes of

              single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of 166,242 cells isolated

              microbiota can influence many physiologic processes (including
              development, metabolism and immune cell function) and are
              associated with susceptibility to multiple diseases2. Alterations
              in the microbiota can also modulate host behaviours-such as
              social activity, stress, and anxiety-related responses-that are
              linked to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders3. However, the
              mechanisms by which the microbiota influence neuronal activity
              and host behaviour remain poorly defined. Here we show that
              manipulation of the microbiota in antibiotic-treated or germ-free
              adult mice results in significant deficits in fear extinction
              learning. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the medial prefrontal
              cortex of the brain revealed significant alterations in gene
              expression in excitatory neurons, glia and other cell types.
              Transcranial two-photon imaging showed that deficits in
              extinction learning after manipulation of the microbiota in adult
              mice were associated with defective learning-related remodelling
              of postsynaptic dendritic spines and reduced activity in
              cue-encoding neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. In
              addition, selective re-establishment of the microbiota revealed a
              limited neonatal developmental window in which microbiota-derived
              signals can restore normal extinction learning in adulthood.
              Finally, unbiased metabolomic analysis identified four
              metabolites that were significantly downregulated in germ-free
              mice and have been reported to be related to neuropsychiatric

              microbiota-derived compounds may directly affect brain function

              regional gene-expression patterns remained largely reproducible
              across individuals. We analysed chimpanzee and macaque cerebral
              organoids and found that human neuronal development occurs at a
              slower pace relative to the other two primates. Using
              pseudotemporal alignment of differentiation paths, we found that
              human-specific gene expression resolved to distinct cell states
              along progenitor-to-neuron lineages in the cortex. Chromatin
              accessibility was dynamic during cortex development, and we
              identified divergence in accessibility between human and
              chimpanzee that correlated with human-specific gene expression
              and genetic change. Finally, we mapped human-specific expression
              in adult prefrontal cortex using single-nucleus RNA sequencing
              analysis and identified developmental differences that persist
              into adulthood, as well as cell-state-specific changes that occur
              exclusively in the adult brain. Our data provide a temporal cell

              underlying mechanisms and causality remain poorly understood1-3.
              A subset of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) lack
              canonical kinase mutations but instead have succinate
              dehydrogenase (SDH) deficiency and global DNA
              hyper-methylation4,5. Here, we associate this hyper-methylation
              with changes in genome topology that activate oncogenic programs.
              To investigate epigenetic alterations systematically, we mapped
              DNA methylation, CTCF insulators, enhancers, and chromosome
              topology in KIT-mutant, PDGFRA-mutant and SDH-deficient GISTs.
              Although these respective subtypes shared similar enhancer
              landscapes, we identified hundreds of putative insulators where
              DNA methylation replaced CTCF binding in SDH-deficient GISTs. We
              focused on a disrupted insulator that normally partitions a core
              GIST super-enhancer from the FGF4 oncogene. Recurrent loss of
              this insulator alters locus topology in SDH-deficient GISTs,
              allowing aberrant physical interaction between enhancer and
              oncogene. CRISPR-mediated excision of the corresponding CTCF
              motifs in an SDH-intact GIST model disrupted the boundary between
              enhancer and oncogene, and strongly upregulated FGF4 expression.
              We also identified a second recurrent insulator loss event near
              the KIT oncogene, which is also highly expressed across
              SDH-deficient GISTs. Finally, we established a patient-derived
              xenograft (PDX) from an SDH-deficient GIST that faithfully
              maintains the epigenetics of the parental tumour, including
              hypermethylation and insulator defects. This PDX model is highly
              sensitive to FGF receptor (FGFR) inhibition, and more so to
              combined FGFR and KIT inhibition, validating the functional
              significance of the underlying epigenetic lesions. Our study
              reveals how epigenetic alterations can drive oncogenic programs
              in the absence of canonical kinase mutations, with implications
              for mechanistic targeting of aberrant pathways in cancers.",

              The initial exit from pluripotency coincides with the

              at enhancer marks, driven by ten-eleven translocation
              (TET)-mediated demethylation and a concomitant increase of

              landscape of ectodermal cells is already established in the early

              However, the fidelity of organoid models remains unclear3-5. Here
              we analyse the transcriptomes of individual primary human
              cortical cells from different developmental periods and cortical
              areas. We find that cortical development is characterized by
              progenitor maturation trajectories, the emergence of diverse cell
              subtypes and areal specification of newborn neurons. By contrast,
              organoids contain broad cell classes, but do not recapitulate
              distinct cellular subtype identities and appropriate progenitor
              maturation. Although the molecular signatures of cortical areas
              emerge in organoid neurons, they are not spatially segregated.
              Organoids also ectopically activate cellular stress pathways,
              which impairs cell-type specification. However, organoid stress
              and subtype defects are alleviated by transplantation into the
              mouse cortex. Together, these datasets and analytical tools
              provide a framework for evaluating and improving the accuracy of

              organization and accessibility, both in gametes5-8 and after
              fertilization5,8-10. However, these studies have led to very
              different conclusions: the global absence of local
              topological-associated domains (TADs) in gametes and their
              appearance in the embryo8,9 versus the pre-existence of TADs and
              loops in the zygote5,11. The questions of whether parental
              structures can be inherited in the newly formed embryo and how
              these structures might relate to allele-specific gene regulation
              remain open. Here we map genomic interactions for each parental
              genome (including the X chromosome), using an optimized
              single-cell high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (HiC)
              protocol12,13, during preimplantation in the mouse. We integrate
              chromosome organization with allelic expression states and
              chromatin marks, and reveal that higher-order chromatin structure
              after fertilization coincides with an allele-specific enrichment
              of methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27. These early
              parental-specific domains correlate with gene repression and
              participate in parentally biased gene expression-including in
              recently described, transiently imprinted loci14. We also find
              TADs that arise in a non-parental-specific manner during a second
              wave of genome assembly. These de novo domains are associated
              with active chromatin. Finally, we obtain insights into the
              relationship between TADs and gene expression by investigating
              structural changes to the paternal X chromosome before and during
              X chromosome inactivation in preimplantation female embryos15. We
              find that TADs are lost as genes become silenced on the paternal
              X chromosome but linger in regions that escape X chromosome
              inactivation. These findings demonstrate the complex dynamics of

              interactions, but also facilitates the generation of

              Using these maps, we identify noncoding RNA targets globally, and
              discern RNA topological domains and trans-interacting hubs. We
              reveal that the functional connectivity of enhancers and
              promoters can be assigned using their pairwise-interacting RNAs.
              Furthermore, we show that CCAT1-5L-a super-enhancer hub

              Such proteins include a group of predicted interbacterial toxins
              of the deaminase superfamily, members of which have found
              application in gene-editing techniques1,2. Because previously
              described cytidine deaminases operate on single-stranded nucleic
              acids3, their use in base editing requires the unwinding of
              double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-for example by a CRISPR-Cas9 system.
              Base editing within mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), however, has thus
              far been hindered by challenges associated with the delivery of
              guide RNA into the mitochondria4. As a consequence, manipulation
              of mtDNA to date has been limited to the targeted destruction of
              the mitochondrial genome by designer nucleases9,10.Here we
              describe an interbacterial toxin, which we name DddA, that
              catalyses the deamination of cytidines within dsDNA. We
              engineered split-DddA halves that are non-toxic and inactive

              respiration rates and oxidative phosphorylation. CRISPR-free
              DdCBEs enable the precise manipulation of mtDNA, rather than the
              elimination of mtDNA copies that results from its cleavage by

              phenotypic traits1, but it remains challenging to distinguish
              variants that affect regulatory function2. Genomic DNase I
              footprinting enables the quantitative, nucleotide-resolution
              delineation of sites of transcription factor occupancy within
              native chromatin3-6. However, only a small fraction of such sites
              have been precisely resolved on the human genome sequence6. Here,
              to enable comprehensive mapping of transcription factor
              footprints, we produced high-density DNase I cleavage maps from
              243 human cell and tissue types and states and integrated these
              data to delineate about 4.5 million compact genomic elements that
              encode transcription factor occupancy at nucleotide resolution.
              We map the fine-scale structure within about 1.6 million DNase
              I-hypersensitive sites and show that the overwhelming majority
              are populated by well-spaced sites of single transcription

              chiefly executed by wholesale modulation of accessibility at
              regulatory DNA rather than by differential transcription factor
              occupancy within accessible elements. We also show that the

              attributable to variants within footprints, and that functional

              properties, are very common in cancer1,2. Here we studied the
              effects of hotspot gain-of-function mutations in Trp53 (the gene
              that encodes p53 in mice) in mouse models of WNT-driven
              intestinal cancer caused by Csnk1a1 deletion3,4 or ApcMin
              mutation5. Cancer in these models is known to be facilitated by
              loss of p533,6. We found that mutant versions of p53 had
              contrasting effects in different segments of the gut: in the
              distal gut, mutant p53 had the expected oncogenic effect;
              however, in the proximal gut and in tumour organoids it had a
              pronounced tumour-suppressive effect. In the tumour-suppressive
              mode, mutant p53 eliminated dysplasia and tumorigenesis in
              Csnk1a1-deficient and ApcMin/+ mice, and promoted normal growth
              and differentiation of tumour organoids derived from these mice.
              In these settings, mutant p53 was more effective than wild-type
              p53 at inhibiting tumour formation. Mechanistically, the
              tumour-suppressive effects of mutant p53 were driven by
              disruption of the WNT pathway, through preventing the binding of
              TCF4 to chromatin. Notably, this tumour-suppressive effect was
              completely abolished by the gut microbiome. Moreover, a single
              metabolite derived from the gut microbiota-gallic acid-could
              reproduce the entire effect of the microbiome. Supplementing
              gut-sterilized p53-mutant mice and p53-mutant organoids with
              gallic acid reinstated the TCF4-chromatin interaction and the
              hyperactivation of WNT, thus conferring a malignant phenotype to
              the organoids and throughout the gut. Our study demonstrates the
              substantial plasticity of a cancer mutation and highlights the

              been reported so far, with particular focus on mechanisms that
              are linked to intestinal barrier disruption, genotoxicity and

              unclear whether the maternal gut microbiome influences
              neurodevelopment during critical prenatal periods and in the
              absence of environmental challenges. Here we investigate how
              depletion and selective reconstitution of the maternal gut
              microbiome influences fetal neurodevelopment in mice. Embryos
              from antibiotic-treated and germ-free dams exhibited reduced
              brain expression of genes related to axonogenesis, deficient
              thalamocortical axons and impaired outgrowth of thalamic axons in
              response to cell-extrinsic factors. Gnotobiotic colonization of
              microbiome-depleted dams with a limited consortium of bacteria
              prevented abnormalities in fetal brain gene expression and
              thalamocortical axonogenesis. Metabolomic profiling revealed that
              the maternal microbiome regulates numerous small molecules in the
              maternal serum and the brains of fetal offspring. Select
              microbiota-dependent metabolites promoted axon outgrowth from
              fetal thalamic explants. Moreover, maternal supplementation with
              these metabolites abrogated deficiencies in fetal thalamocortical
              axons. Manipulation of the maternal microbiome and microbial
              metabolites during pregnancy yielded adult offspring with altered
              tactile sensitivity in two aversive somatosensory behavioural
              tasks, but no overt differences in many other sensorimotor
              behaviours. Together, our findings show that the maternal gut
              microbiome promotes fetal thalamocortical axonogenesis, probably

              that enable cancer cells to evade killing mediated by cytotoxic T
              lymphocytes (CTLs), we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens
              across a panel of genetically diverse mouse cancer cell lines
              that were cultured in the presence of CTLs. We identify a core
              set of 182 genes across these mouse cancer models, the individual
              perturbation of which increases either the sensitivity or the
              resistance of cancer cells to CTL-mediated toxicity. Systematic
              exploration of our dataset using genetic co-similarity reveals
              the hierarchical and coordinated manner in which genes and
              pathways act in cancer cells to orchestrate their evasion of
              CTLs, and shows that discrete functional modules that control the
              interferon response and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced
              cytotoxicity are dominant sub-phenotypes. Our data establish a
              central role for genes that were previously identified as
              negative regulators of the type-II interferon response (for
              example, Ptpn2, Socs1 and Adar1) in mediating CTL evasion, and
              show that the lipid-droplet-related gene Fitm2 is required for
              maintaining cell fitness after exposure to interferon-$\gamma$

              a conserved mediator of the evasion of CTLs by cancer cells, and
              show that this pathway is required to resist cytotoxicity induced
              by the cytokines IFN$\gamma$ and TNF. Through the mapping of
              cytokine- and CTL-based genetic interactions, together with in

              autophagy control cancer-cell-intrinsic evasion of killing by
              CTLs and we highlight the importance of these effects within the
              tumour microenvironment. Collectively, these data expand our

              across homologous brain regions from three primates (human,

              Homologous interneuron types-which were readily identified by
              their RNA-expression patterns-varied in abundance and RNA
              expression among ferrets, mice and primates, but varied less
              among primates. Only a modest fraction of the genes identified as
              'markers' of specific interneuron subtypes in any one species had
              this property in another species. In the primate neocortex,

              counterpart in mice or ferrets. These interneurons expressed a
              unique combination of genes that encode transcription factors,

              pure water. Conversely, the loss of body fluid induces
              hypovolaemic thirst, in which animals seek both water and
              minerals (salts) to recover blood volume. Circumventricular

              divergence in gene expression is around 20\% lower at the

              extensive buffering between the expression layers, which

              Translational upregulation specifically counterbalanced global

              Changes to DNA methylation patterns over time form the basis of

              Here we show that genetic ablation of a lncRNA locus on human

              identified homozygous 27-63-kilobase deletions located 300

              characterization of cell type diversity in the brain1, neuronal
              cell types are often studied out of the context of their

              define cortical neurons, here we combined retrograde labelling
              with single-nucleus DNA methylation sequencing to link neural
              epigenomic properties to projections. We examined 11,827 single
              neocortical neurons from 63 cortico-cortical and
              cortico-subcortical long-distance projections. Our results showed
              unique epigenetic signatures of projection neurons that
              correspond to their laminar and regional location and projection
              patterns. On the basis of their epigenomes, intra-telencephalic
              cells that project to different cortical targets could be further
              distinguished, and some layer 5 neurons that project to
              extra-telencephalic targets (L5 ET) formed separate clusters that
              aligned with their axonal projections. Such separation varied
              between cortical areas, which suggests that there are
              area-specific differences in L5 ET subtypes, which were further
              validated by anatomical studies. Notably, a population of
              cortico-cortical projection neurons clustered with L5 ET rather
              than intra-telencephalic neurons, which suggests that a
              population of L5 ET cortical neurons projects to both targets. We

              neurons, which revealed axon terminals in extra-telencephalic
              targets including the thalamus, superior colliculus and pons.

              neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the particular
              importance of DNA repair in long-lived post-mitotic neurons1,2.
              The cellular genome is subjected to a constant barrage of
              endogenous DNA damage, but surprisingly little is known about the
              identity of the lesion(s) that accumulate in neurons and whether
              they accrue throughout the genome or at specific loci. Here we
              show that post-mitotic neurons accumulate unexpectedly high
              levels of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) at specific sites
              within the genome. Genome-wide mapping reveals that SSBs are
              located within enhancers at or near CpG dinucleotides and sites
              of DNA demethylation. These SSBs are repaired by PARP1 and
              XRCC1-dependent mechanisms. Notably, deficiencies in
              XRCC1-dependent short-patch repair increase DNA repair synthesis
              at neuronal enhancers, whereas defects in long-patch repair
              reduce synthesis. The high levels of SSB repair in neuronal
              enhancers are therefore likely to be sustained by both
              short-patch and long-patch processes. These data provide the
              first evidence of site- and cell-type-specific SSB repair,
              revealing unexpected levels of localized and continuous DNA
              breakage in neurons. In addition, they suggest an explanation for
              the neurodegenerative phenotypes that occur in patients with

               contain transcription-factor-binding sites (which are typically
               around 7--22 bp), and physical contact between the promoters and
               enhancers is thought to be required to modulate gene expression.
               Although chromatin architecture has been mapped extensively at
               resolutions of 1 kilobase and above; it has not been possible to
               define physical contacts at the scale of the proteins that
               determine gene expression. Here we define these interactions in
               detail using a chromosome conformation capture method
               (Micro-Capture-C) that enables the physical contacts between
               different classes of regulatory elements to be determined at

               in which chromatin loop extrusion1 is dependent on cohesin

               formation of tissue-specific chromatin domains without changes

              morphogenetic gradients are known to establish early brain
              regions and cortical areas, but how early patterns result in

              cell types, including radial glia, the neural progenitors of the

              Using an automated, multiplexed single-molecule fluorescent in

               cortical interneurons, parvalbumin- and somatostatin-positive
               cells, are morphologically and functionally distinct in
               adulthood but arise from common lineages within the medial
               ganglionic eminence4--11. This makes them an attractive model
               for studying the generation of cell diversity. Here we examine
               how developmental changes in transcription and chromatin
               structure enable these cells to acquire distinct identities in
               the mouse cortex. Generic interneuron features are first
               detected upon cell cycle exit through the opening of chromatin
               at distal elements. By constructing cell-type-specific gene
               regulatory networks, we observed that parvalbumin- and
               somatostatin-positive cells initiate distinct programs upon
               settling within the cortex. We used these networks to model the
               differential transcriptional requirement of a shared regulator,
               Mef2c, and confirmed the accuracy of our predictions through
               experimental loss-of-function experiments. We therefore reveal
               how a common molecular program diverges to enable these neuronal
               subtypes to acquire highly specialized properties by adulthood.
               Our methods provide a framework for examining the emergence of
               cellular diversity, as well as for quantifying and predicting
               the effect of candidate genes on cell-type-specific development.

              fundamental network motifs in the brain. Revealing its structural
              and functional organization is critical to understanding
              cognition, sensorimotor behaviour, and the natural history of
              many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Classically,
              this network is conceptualized to contain three information
              channels: motor, limbic and associative1-4. Yet this
              three-channel view cannot explain the myriad functions of the
              basal ganglia. We previously subdivided the dorsal striatum into
              29 functional domains on the basis of the topography of inputs
              from the entire cortex5. Here we map the multi-synaptic output
              pathways of these striatal domains through the globus pallidus
              external part (GPe), substantia nigra reticular part (SNr),
              thalamic nuclei and cortex. Accordingly, we identify 14 SNr and
              36 GPe domains and a direct cortico-SNr projection. The
              striatonigral direct pathway displays a greater convergence of
              striatal inputs than the more parallel striatopallidal indirect
              pathway, although direct and indirect pathways originating from
              the same striatal domain ultimately converge onto the same
              postsynaptic SNr neurons. Following the SNr outputs, we delineate
              six domains in the parafascicular and ventromedial thalamic
              nuclei. Subsequently, we identify six parallel cortico-basal
              ganglia-thalamic subnetworks that sequentially transduce specific
              subsets of cortical information through every elemental node of
              the cortico- basal ganglia-thalamic loop. Thalamic domains relay
              this output back to the originating corticostriatal neurons of

               projection neurons (ICPN), which send axon branches across
               cortical areas as well as to subcortical targets7--9. Although
               ICPN are anatomically diverse10--14, they are molecularly

               functional features emerge during development remains largely
               unknown. Here we address this question by linking the connectome
               and transcriptome in developing single ICPN of the mouse
               neocortex using a combination of multiplexed analysis of
               projections by sequencing16,17 (MAPseq, to identify
               single-neuron axonal projections) and single-cell RNA sequencing
               (to identify corresponding gene expression). Focusing on neurons
               of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we reveal a protracted
               unfolding of the molecular and functional differentiation of
               motor cortex-projecting (
               $$\textbackslashvec\{\{\textbackslashrm\{M\}\}\}$$ ) ICPN
               compared with secondary somatosensory cortex-projecting (
               $$\textbackslashvec\{\{\textbackslashrm\{S\}\}2\}$$ ) ICPN. We
               identify SOX11 as a temporally differentially expressed
               transcription factor in
               $$\textbackslashvec\{\{\textbackslashrm\{M\}\}\}$$ versus
               $$\textbackslashvec\{\{\textbackslashrm\{S\}\}2\}$$ ICPN.
               Postnatal manipulation of SOX11 expression in S1 impaired
               sensorimotor connectivity and disrupted selective exploratory
               behaviours in mice. Together, our results reveal that within a
               single cortical area, different subtypes of ICPN have distinct
               postnatal paces of molecular differentiation, which are
               subsequently reflected in distinct circuit connectivities and
               functions. Dynamic differences in the expression levels of a
               largely generic set of genes, rather than fundamental
               differences in the identity of developmental genetic programs,
               may thus account for the emergence of intra-type diversity in
               cortical neurons. Combined analysis of the connectome and
               transcriptome in the mouse cortex indicates that dynamic
               differences in expression levels of largely generic sets of

               principles imparted by genetic intratumour heterogeneity are
               becoming increasingly clear1, little is known about the
               non-genetic mechanisms that contribute to intratumour
               heterogeneity and malignant clonal fitness2. Here, using
               single-cell profiling and lineage tracing (SPLINTR)---an
               expressed barcoding strategy---we trace isogenic clones in three
               clinically relevant mouse models of acute myeloid leukaemia. We
               find that malignant clonal dominance is a cell-intrinsic and
               heritable property that is facilitated by the repression of
               antigen presentation and increased expression of the secretory
               leukocyte peptidase inhibitor gene (Slpi), which we genetically
               validate as a regulator of acute myeloid leukaemia. Increased
               transcriptional heterogeneity is a feature that enables clonal
               fitness in diverse tissues and immune microenvironments and in
               the context of clonal competition between genetically distinct
               clones. Similar to haematopoietic stem cells3, leukaemia stem
               cells (LSCs) display heritable clone-intrinsic properties of
               high, and low clonal output that contribute to the overall
               tumour mass. We demonstrate that LSC clonal output dictates
               sensitivity to chemotherapy and, although high- and low-output
               clones adapt differently to therapeutic pressure, they
               coordinately emerge from minimal residual disease with increased
               expression of the LSC program. Together, these data provide
               fundamental insights into the non-genetic transcriptional
               processes that underpin malignant clonal fitness and may inform
               future therapeutic strategies. Non-genetic malignant clonal
               dominance is a cell-intrinsic and heritable property that

               complete fitness landscapes, in which DNA sequences are mapped
               to fitness, is a long-standing goal in biology, but has remained
               elusive because it is challenging to generalize reliably to vast
               sequence spaces4--6. Here we build sequence-to-expression models
               that capture fitness landscapes and use them to decipher
               principles of regulatory evolution. Using millions of randomly
               sampled promoter DNA sequences and their measured expression
               levels in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we learn deep
               neural network models that generalize with excellent prediction

               under genetic drift and strong-selection weak-mutation regimes

               diminishing returns epistasis; that conflicting expression

               approach for using such models to detect signatures of selection
               on expression from natural variation in regulatory sequences and
               use it to discover an instance of convergent regulatory
               evolution. We assess mutational robustness, finding that

              present Palantir, an algorithm that models trajectories of

              process and leverages entropy to measure cell plasticity along

              decompose cell type mixtures while correcting for differences

              and subtype localization patterns in Slide-seq and Visium

              By applying knowledge of the cellular taxonomy of the brain from
              single-cell RNA sequencing, we evaluated whether the genomic loci
              implicated in schizophrenia map onto specific brain cell types.
              We found that the common-variant genomic results consistently
              mapped to pyramidal cells, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and
              certain interneurons, but far less consistently to embryonic,

              genes that were specifically expressed in each of these cell

              limited set of neurons, and the gene sets point to the same
              cells. The genetic risk associated with MSNs did not overlap with
              that of glutamatergic pyramidal cells and interneurons,

              a low or high anxiety group by consensus clustering using seven
              anxiety-related phenotypes. Genome-wide association analysis
              (GWAS) identified 141 genes (264 SNPs) significantly enriched for
              anxiety and depression related functions. In the same CC cohort,
              we measured GM composition and identified five families that
              differ between high and low anxiety mice. Anxiety level was
              predicted with 79\% accuracy and an AUC of 0.81. Mediation
              analyses revealed that the genetic contribution to anxiety was
              partially mediated by the GM. Our findings indicate that GM

              interactions between immune cells and blood vessels. However, it
              has been difficult to image and model these interactions under
              realistic conditions. In this study, we fabricated a perfusion
              and imaging chamber to allow the real-time visualization of
              leukocyte perfusion, adhesion, and migration inside a
              tissue-engineered blood vessel (TEBV). We monitored the elevated
              monocyte adhesion to the TEBV wall and transendothelial migration
              (TEM) as the TEBV endothelium was activated by the inflammatory
              cytokine TNF-$\alpha$. We demonstrated that treatment with
              anti-TNF-$\alpha$ or an NF-kB signaling pathway inhibitor would
              attenuate the endothelium activation and reduce the number of
              leukocyte adhesion (>74\%) and TEM events (>87\%) close to the
              control. As the first demonstration of real-time imaging of
              dynamic cellular events within a TEBV, this work paves the way

              turn, can be readily compared with commonplace
              ``chain-of-command'' structures in social networks, which have
              characteristic hierarchical layouts. Here, we develop algorithms
              for identifying generalized hierarchies (allowing for various
              loop structures) and use these approaches to illuminate extensive
              pyramid-shaped hierarchical structures existing in the regulatory
              networks of representative prokaryotes (Escherichia coli) and
              eukaryotes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), with most TFs at the
              bottom levels and only a few master TFs on top. These masters are
              situated near the center of the protein-protein interaction
              network, a different type of network from the regulatory one, and
              they receive most of the input for the whole regulatory hierarchy

              influence over other genes, in terms of affecting

              bottom of the regulatory hierarchy are more essential to the
              viability of the cell. Finally, one might think master TFs
              achieve their wide influence through directly regulating many
              targets, but TFs with most direct targets are in the middle of
              the hierarchy. We find, in fact, that these midlevel TFs are
              ``control bottlenecks'' in the hierarchy, and this great degree
              of control for ``middle managers'' has parallels in efficient

              axis in the same cohort. The phenomenon of orthogonal gradations
              in cortical organization evident in different structural and
              functional properties may originate from genetic gradients.
              Another emerging theme of cortical patterning is that patterns of
              genetic influences recapitulate the spatial topography of the
              cortex within hemispheres. The genetic patterning of both
              cortical thickness and surface area corresponds to cortical
              functional specializations. Intriguingly, in contrast to broad
              similarities in genetic patterning, two sets of analyses
              distinguish cortical thickness and surface area genetically.
              First, genetic contributions to cortical thickness and surface
              area are largely distinct; there is very little genetic
              correlation (i.e., shared genetic influences) between them.
              Second, organizing principles among genetically defined regions
              differ between thickness and surface area. Examining the
              structure of the genetic similarity matrix among clusters
              revealed that, whereas surface area clusters showed great genetic
              proximity with clusters from the same lobe, thickness clusters
              appear to have close genetic relatedness with clusters that have
              similar maturational timing. The discrepancies are in line with
              evidence that the two traits follow different mechanisms in
              neurodevelopment. Our findings highlight the complexity of
              genetic influences on cortical morphology and provide a glimpse
              into emerging principles of genetic organization of the cortex.",

              is caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG binding

              analyses of genomic binding of MeCP2, gene-expression data, and
              patterns of DNA methylation. In addition to the expected
              high-affinity binding to methylated cytosine in the CG context

              suggesting that MeCP2 binding at mCH loci is key for regulating
              neuronal gene expression in vivo. This pattern is unique to the
              maturing and adult nervous system, as it requires the increase in
              mCH after birth to guide differential MeCP2 binding among mCG,
              mCH, and nonmethylated DNA elements. Notably, MeCP2 binds mCH

  abstract = "Highly multiplexed single-molecule FISH has emerged as a
              promising approach to spatially resolved single-cell
              transcriptomics because of its ability to directly image and
              profile numerous RNA species in their native cellular context.
              However, background-from off-target binding of FISH probes and
              cellular autofluorescence-can become limiting in a number of
              important applications, such as increasing the degree of
              multiplexing, imaging shorter RNAs, and imaging tissue samples.
              Here, we developed a sample clearing approach for FISH
              measurements. We identified off-target binding of FISH probes to
              cellular components other than RNA, such as proteins, as a major
              source of background. To remove this source of background, we
              embedded samples in polyacrylamide, anchored RNAs to this
              polyacrylamide matrix, and cleared cellular proteins and lipids,
              which are also sources of autofluorescence. To demonstrate the
              efficacy of this approach, we measured the copy number of 130 RNA
              species in cleared samples using multiplexed error-robust FISH
              (MERFISH). We observed a reduction both in the background because
              of off-target probe binding and in the cellular autofluorescence
              without detectable loss in RNA. This process led to an improved
              detection efficiency and detection limit of MERFISH, and an
              increased measurement throughput via extension of MERFISH into
              four color channels. We further demonstrated MERFISH measurements
              of complex tissue samples from the mouse brain using this
              matrix-imprinting and -clearing approach. We envision that this
              method will improve the performance of a wide range of in situ

              The TAM-induced inhibition of NPC proliferation led to deficits

              The approach revealed protein arginine methyltransferase gene 5

              amplicons to quantify the expression of chosen genes. HyPR-seq

              allows simultaneous quantification of two distinct species: RNA

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: The regulatory machinery controlling gene expression
              is complex, frequently requiring multiple, simultaneous
              DNA-protein interactions. The rate at which a gene is transcribed
              may depend upon the presence or absence of a collection of
              transcription factors bound to the DNA near the gene. Locating
              transcription factor binding sites in genomic DNA is difficult
              because the individual sites are small and tend to occur
              frequently by chance. True binding sites may be identified by
              their tendency to occur in clusters, sometimes known as
              regulatory modules. RESULTS: We describe an algorithm for
              detecting occurrences of regulatory modules in genomic DNA. The
              algorithm, called mcast, takes as input a DNA database and a
              collection of binding site motifs that are known to operate in
              concert. mcast uses a motif-based hidden Markov model with
              several novel features. The model incorporates motif-specific
              p-values, thereby allowing scores from motifs of different widths
              and specificities to be compared directly. The p-value scoring
              also allows mcast to only accept motif occurrences with
              significance below a user-specified threshold, while still
              assigning better scores to motif occurrences with lower p-values.
              mcast can search long DNA sequences, modeling length
              distributions between motifs within a regulatory module, but
              ignoring length distributions between modules. The algorithm

              ordering of points is iteratively permuted in search of a linear
              ordering, which can be used to study embedded shapes. Several
              examples indicate how the shapes of certain structures in the
              data (elongated, circular and compact) manifest themselves
              visually in our permuted distance matrix. It is important to
              identify the elongated objects since they are often associated
              with a set of hidden variables, underlying continuous variation
              in the data. The problem of determining an optimal linear
              ordering is shown to be NP-Complete, and therefore an iterative

              progression and ultimately to predict drug response. We have
              developed a method called Tied Diffusion Through Interacting
              Events (TieDIE) that uses a network diffusion approach to connect
              genomic perturbations to gene expression changes characteristic
              of cancer subtypes. The method computes a subnetwork of
              protein-protein interactions, predicted transcription
              factor-to-target connections and curated interactions from
              literature that connects genomic and transcriptomic
              perturbations. RESULTS: Application of TieDIE to The Cancer
              Genome Atlas and a breast cancer cell line dataset identified key
              signaling pathways, with examples impinging on MYC activity.
              Interlinking genes are predicted to correspond to essential
              components of cancer signaling and may provide a mechanistic

              to large datasets. Tested on 207 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets, our

               MethylSig takes into account both read coverage and biological
               variation by utilizing a beta-binomial approach across
               biological samples for a CpG site or region, and identifies

               variance estimation for experiments with small sample size. A

               investigating its alterations in complex diseases such as
               cancer. While early studies were mostly restricted to CpG
               islands or promoter regions, recent findings indicate that many
               of important DNA methylation changes can occur in other regions
               and DNA methylation needs to be examined on a genome-wide scale.
               In this article, we apply the wavelet-based functional mixed

               data for identifying differentially methylated loci across the

               outperforms analogous approaches modeling the loci as

               modification that has essential role in gene regulation, cell
               differentiation and cancer development. Bisulfite sequencing is
               a widely used technique to obtain genome-wide DNA methylation
               profiles, and one of the key tasks of analyzing bisulfite
               sequencing data is to detect differentially methylated regions
               (DMRs) among samples under different treatment conditions.
               Although numerous tools have been proposed to detect
               differentially methylated single CpG site (DMC) between samples,
               methods for direct DMR detection, especially for complex study
               designs, are largely limited. RESULTS: We present a new
               software, GetisDMR, for direct DMR detection. We use
               beta-binomial regression to model the whole-genome bisulfite
               sequencing data, where variations in methylation levels and
               confounding effects have been accounted for. We employ a
               region-wise test statistic, which is derived from local
               Getis-Ord statistics and considers the spatial correlation
               between nearby CpG sites, to detect DMRs. Unlike existing
               methods, that attempt to infer DMRs from DMCs based on empirical
               criteria, we provide statistical inference for direct DMR
               detection. Through extensive simulations and an application to
               two mouse datasets, we demonstrate that GetisDMR achieves better
               sensitivities, positive predictive values, more exact locations
               and better agreement of DMRs with current biological knowledge.

              While the methylation status of individual cytosines can

  abstract = "An increasing number of studies are using single-cell
              RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the gene expression
              profiles of individual cells. One common analysis applied to
              scRNA-seq data involves detecting differentially expressed (DE)
              genes between cells in different biological groups. However, many
              experiments are designed such that the cells to be compared are
              processed in separate plates or chips, meaning that the groupings
              are confounded with systematic plate effects. This confounding
              aspect is frequently ignored in DE analyses of scRNA-seq data. In
              this article, we demonstrate that failing to consider plate
              effects in the statistical model results in loss of type I error

              used in the DE analysis. This restores type I error control in
              the presence of plate effects without compromising detection
              power in simulated data. Summation is also robust to varying
              numbers and library sizes of cells on each plate. Similar results

              interested in detecting differentially methylated regions,
              composed of multiple sites with differing methylation levels
              among populations. However, current computational approaches for
              detecting such regions do not provide accurate statistical

              the computational function of lamina-specific synaptic connection

              on this problem had focused on hypothesized specific

              layers and had tested these hypotheses through simulations of
              abstract neural network models. We approach this problem by
              studying instead the dynamical system defined by more realistic
              cortical microcircuit models as a whole and by investigating the
              influence that its laminar structure has on the transmission and
              fusion of information within this dynamical system. The circuit
              models that we examine consist of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with
              dynamic synapses, based on detailed data from Thomson and others
              (2002), Markram and others (1998), and Gupta and others (2000).

              genetically instructed within their parental progenitors,

              in the eukaryotic nucleus with transcriptionally active regions

              regions are marked by H3K9me2. But unlike the nuclear peripheral
              Lamina-Associated Domains (LADs), these novel, enhancer-rich

              eukaryotic genomes. Hence the genome-wide distribution of
              5-methylcytosine, or the methylome, has been attracting intense
              attention. In recent years, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing
              (WGBS) has enabled methylome analysis at single-base resolution.
              However, WGBS typically requires microgram quantities of DNA as
              well as global PCR amplification, thereby precluding its

              because bisulfite treatment of adaptor-tagged templates, which is
              inherent to current WGBS methods, leads to substantial DNA
              fragmentation. To circumvent the bisulfite-induced loss of intact
              sequencing templates, we conceived an alternative method termed
              Post-Bisulfite Adaptor Tagging (PBAT) wherein bisulfite treatment

              This method projects multiple types of genomic data onto a common

               detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between paired
               samples. Although numerous tools have been proposed for mC
               calling, methods for DMR detection have been largely limited.
               Here, we present Bisulfighter, a new software package for
               detecting mCs and DMRs from bisulfite sequencing data.
               Bisulfighter combines the LAST alignment tool for mC calling,
               and a novel framework for DMR detection based on hidden Markov
               models (HMMs). Unlike previous attempts that depend on empirical
               parameters, Bisulfighter can use the expectation-maximization
               algorithm for HMMs to adjust parameters for each data set. We
               conduct extensive experiments in which accuracy of mC calling

               contexts, read qualities, sequencing depths and DMR lengths, as
               well as on real data from a wide range of biological processes.

              tissue-specific gene regulation is unclear. Recently, the
              DNA-binding protein CTCF has been shown to participate in the
              regulation of alternative splicing in a DNA methylation-dependent
              manner. To globally evaluate the relationship between DNA
              methylation and tissue-specific alternative splicing, we
              performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of mouse retina
              and brain. In protein-coding genes, tissue-specific
              differentially methylated regions (T-DMRs) were preferentially
              located in exons and introns. Gene ontology and evolutionary
              conservation analysis suggest that these T-DMRs are likely to be
              biologically relevant. More than 14\% of alternatively spliced
              genes were associated with a T-DMR. T-DMR-associated genes were
              enriched for developmental genes, suggesting that a specific set
              of alternatively spliced genes may be regulated through DNA
              methylation. Novel DNA sequences motifs overrepresented in T-DMRs
              were identified as being associated with positive and/or negative
              regulation of alternative splicing in a position-dependent
              context. The majority of these evolutionarily conserved motifs
              contain a CpG dinucleotide. Some transcription factors, which
              recognize these motifs, are known to be involved in splicing. Our
              results suggest that DNA methylation-dependent alternative
              splicing is widespread and lay the foundation for further

              the measurement of DNA methylation at single nucleotide
              resolution through methods such as whole-genome bisulfite
              sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. In

              under distinct biological contexts, for example, between tumor
              and normal tissue. A challenge in sequencing studies is that the
              number of biological replicates is often limited by the costs of
              sequencing. The small number of replicates leads to unstable
              variance estimation, which can reduce accuracy to detect

              Thus, it is important to develop computational methods for
              accurate TF binding prediction in open-chromatin regions (OCRs).
              Here, we report a novel segmentation-based method, TEPIC, to

              matrices. TEPIC can be applied to various open-chromatin data,
              e.g. DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq. Additionally, Histone-Marks (HMs)
              can be used to identify candidate TF binding sites. TEPIC

              high-throughput methods stimulated the production of novel
              collections with increasing numbers of motifs. Meta-databases,
              built by merging these collections, contain redundant versions,
              because available tools are not suited to automatically identify

              ChIP-seq) also produces redundant motifs, hampering the
              interpretation of results. We present matrix-clustering, a
              versatile tool that clusters similar TFBMs into multiple trees,
              and automatically creates non-redundant TFBM collections. A
              feature unique to matrix-clustering is its dynamic visualisation

              multiple collections from various sources. We demonstrate that
              matrix-clustering considerably simplifies the interpretation of

              highlights biologically relevant variations of similar motifs. We

              with their respective DNA methylation profiles. However, current

              Integrating TFBS motifs with TFBS DNA methylation better portrays

              found that DNA methylation patterns within TFBS can be cell

              neural signals from large-scale electrophysiological data. This
              manuscript describes an efficient, reliable pipeline for spike
              sorting on dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), where neural
              signals appear across many electrodes and spike sorting currently
              represents a major computational bottleneck. We present several
              new techniques that make dense MEA spike sorting more robust and
              scalable. Our pipeline is based on an efficient multi-stage
              ``triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit'' approach that initially
              extracts only clean, high-quality waveforms from the
              electrophysiological time series by temporarily skipping noisy or
              ``collided'' events (representing two neurons firing
              synchronously). This is accomplished by developing a neural
              network detection method followed by efficient outlier triaging.
              The clean waveforms are then used to infer the set of neural
              spike waveform templates through nonparametric Bayesian
              clustering. Our clustering approach adapts a ``coreset'' approach
              for data reduction and uses efficient inference methods in a
              Dirichlet process mixture model framework to dramatically improve
              the scalability and reliability of the entire pipeline. The
              ``triaged'' waveforms are then finally recovered with
              matching-pursuit deconvolution techniques. The proposed methods
              improve on the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and
              stability on both real and biophysically-realistic simulated MEA
              data. Furthermore, the proposed pipeline is efficient, learning
              templates and clustering much faster than real-time for a ≃
              500-electrode dataset, using primarily a single CPU core.",

              modifications are core components of a cell's epigenome, giving
              rise to chromatin states that modulate genome function. Here, we
              systematically profile histone modifications in a diverse panel
              of mouse tissues at 8 developmental stages from 10.5 days post
              conception until birth, performing a total of 1,128 ChIP-seq

              of the mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus. Reducing DNA methylation

              prophylaxis (PrEP) use to STI prevalence in a cohort of PWH with
              a history of unhealthy alcohol use.Methods We analysed data from
              a primary care-based alcohol intervention study at Kaiser
              Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Participants were
              recruited between April 2013 and May 2015 and were followed for
              up to 24 months. We linked participant responses to questions
              from the 24 month follow-up interview, including alcohol and drug
              use and partner PrEP use, with STI test results (ie, syphilis,
              chlamydia, gonorrhoea) in the KPNC electronic health record.
              Prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated using Poisson models fitted
              with robust variance estimators to evaluate the association of
              substance use and partner use of PrEP with STIs.Results In the
              analytic sample (n=465), the median age was 52 years (IQR
              45--59); 67\% were white; 95\% were men who have sex with men.
              Thirty-two per cent of participants had HIV-positive partners
              only; 31\% had HIV-negative partners with at least one on PrEP in
              the previous year and 37\% had HIV-negative partners without any
              on PrEP. Twenty-three per cent reported alcohol and drug use
              prior to sex in the last 6 months. Eight per cent of participants
              had an STI. Partner PrEP use (adjusted PR (aPR) 2.99 (95\% CI
              1.11 to 8.08)) was independently associated with higher STI
              prevalence. Participants who reported use of alcohol (aPR 1.53
              (0.61 to 3.83)), drugs (aPR 1.97 (0.71 to 5.51)) or both (aPR
              1.93 (0.75 to 4.97)) prior to sex had a higher STI

              high-throughput single-cell measurement of gene expression,
              chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation. We previously used
              integrative non-negative matrix factorization (iNMF) to jointly
              learn interpretable low-dimensional representations from multiple
              single-cell datasets using dataset-specific and shared metagene
              factors. These factors provide a principled, quantitative
              definition of cellular identity and how it varies across
              biological contexts. However, datasets exceeding 1 million cells
              are now widely available, creating computational barriers to
              scientific discovery. For instance, it is no longer feasible to
              analyze large datasets using standard pipelines on a personal
              computer with limited memory capacity. Moreover, there is a need
              for an algorithm capable of iteratively refining the definition
              of cellular identity as efforts to create a comprehensive human
              cell atlas continually sequence new cells.To address these
              challenges, we developed an online learning algorithm for
              integrating large and continually arriving single-cell datasets.
              We extended previous online learning approaches for NMF to
              minimize the expected cost of a surrogate function for the iNMF
              objective. We also derived a novel hierarchical alternating least
              squares algorithm for iNMF and incorporated it into an efficient
              online algorithm. Our online approach accesses the training data
              as mini-batches, decoupling memory usage from dataset size and
              allowing on-the-fly incorporation of new datasets as they are
              generated. The online implementation of iNMF converges much more
              quickly using a fraction of the memory required for the batch
              implementation, without sacrificing solution quality. Our new
              approach processes 1.3 million single cells from the entire mouse
              embryo on a laptop in 25 minutes using less than 500 MB of RAM.
              We also analyze large datasets without downloading them to disk
              by streaming them over the internet on demand. Furthermore, we
              construct a single-cell multi-omic cell atlas of the mouse motor
              cortex by iteratively incorporating eight single-cell RNA-seq,
              single-nucleus RNA-seq, single-nucleus ATAC-seq, and
              single-nucleus DNA methylation datasets generated by the BRAIN
              Initiative Cell Census Network.Our approach obviates the need to
              recompute results each time additional cells are sequenced,
              dramatically increases convergence speed, and allows processing
              of datasets too large to fit in memory or on disk. Most
              importantly, it facilitates continual refinement of cell identity
              as new single-cell datasets from different biological contexts
              and data modalities are generated.",

              new types of investigations at unprecedented and unique levels of
              resolution. Among the primary goals of scRNA-Seq is the
              classification of cells into potentially novel cell types. Many
              approaches build on the existing clustering literature to develop
              tools specific to single-cell applications. However, almost all
              of these methods rely on heuristics or user-supplied parameters
              to control the number of clusters identified. This affects both
              the resolution of the clusters within the original dataset as
              well as their replicability across datasets. While many
              recommendations exist to select these tuning parameters, most of
              them are quite ad hoc. In general, there is little assurance that
              any given set of parameters will represent an optimal choice in
              the ever-present trade-off between cluster resolution and
              replicability. For instance, it may be the case that another set
              of parameters will result in more clusters that are also more
              replicable, or in fewer clusters that are also less replicable.
              Here, we propose a new method called Dune for optimizing the
              trade-off between the resolution of the clusters and their
              replicability across datasets. Our method takes as input a set of
              clustering results on a single dataset, derived from any set of
              clustering algorithms and associated tuning parameters, and
              iteratively merges clusters within partitions in order to
              maximize their concordance between partitions. As demonstrated on
              a variety of scRNA-Seq datasets from different platforms, Dune
              outperforms existing techniques, that rely on hierarchical
              merging for reducing the number of clusters, in terms of
              replicability of the resultant merged clusters. It provides an
              objective approach for identifying replicable consensus clusters
              most likely to represent common biological features across
              multiple datasets.",

              types is presently lacking. We used high-throughput
              transcriptional profiling to molecularly define cell types across
              individual lobules of the adult mouse cerebellum. Purkinje and
              granule neurons showed considerable regional specialization, with
              the greatest diversity occurring in the posterior lobules. For
              multiple types of cerebellar interneurons, the molecular
              variation within each type was more continuous, rather than
              discrete. For the unipolar brush cells (UBCs)---an interneuron
              population previously subdivided into two discrete

              emerge from an initially uniform neuroepithelium that, following
              neural tube closure, gives rise to radial glia, the neural stem
              cells of the cortex. Radial glia initially reside in the
              ventricular zone of the cortex, and contribute to cortical
              expansion which is particularly pronounced in the human compared
              to other mammals and non-human primates. To characterize the
              molecular signatures of cellular subtypes that may exist at the
              earliest stages of neurogenesis we performed single-cell
              RNA-sequencing across regions of the developing human brain. We
              observe similar progenitor programs across brain regions that
              each express region-specific transcription factors. In the
              telencephalon, we identify nine progenitor populations,
              suggesting more heterogeneity among neuroepithelial cells and
              radial glia than previously described, including a highly
              prevalent mesenchymal-like population that disappears after the
              onset of neurogenesis. Using velocity analysis, we find that
              genes implicated in various neurodevelopmental diseases drive the
              specification and maintenance of neuroepithelial cells and radial
              glia. Comparison of these progenitor populations to corresponding
              stages of mouse development identifies two progenitor clusters
              that are unique to the early stages of human cortical
              development. Organoid systems display a low fidelity to
              neuroepithelial and early radial glia cell types, but this

  abstract = "ABSTRACT Mapping information from different brains gathered using
              different modalities into a common coordinate space corresponding
              to a reference brain is an aspirational goal in modern
              neuroscience, analogous in importance to mapping genomic data to
              a reference genome. While brain-atlas mapping workflows exist for
              single-modality data (3D MRI or STPT image volumes), generally
              speaking data sets need to be combined across modalities with
              different contrast mechanisms and scale, in the presence of
              missing data as well as signals not present in the reference.
              This has so far been an unsolved problem. We have solved this
              problem in its full generality by developing and implementing a
              rigorous, non-parametric generative framework, that learns
              unknown mappings between contrast mechanisms from data and infers
              missing data. Our methodology permits rigorous quantification of
              the local sale changes between different individual brains, which
              has so far been neglected. We are also able to quantitatively
              characterize the individual variation in shape. Our work
              establishes a quantitative, scalable and streamlined workflow for
              unifying a broad spectrum of multi-modal whole-brain light
              microscopic data volumes into a coordinate-based atlas framework,
              a step that is a prerequisite for large scale integration of
              whole brain data sets in modern neuroscience.Summary A current
              focus of research in neuroscience is to enumerate, map and
              annotate neuronal cell types in whole vertebrate brains using
              different modalities of data acquisition. A key challenge
              remains: can the large multiplicities of molecular anatomical
              data sets from many different modalities, and at widely different
              scales, be all assembled into a common reference space? Solving
              this problem is as important for modern neuroscience as mapping
              to reference genomes was for molecular biology. While workable
              brain-to-atlas mapping workflows exist for single modalities
              (e.g. mapping serial two photon (STP) brains to STP references)
              and largely for clean data, this is generally not a solved
              problem for mapping across contrast modalities, where data sets
              can be partial, and often carry signal not present in the
              reference brain (e.g. tracer injections). Presenting these types
              of anatomical data into a common reference frame for all to use
              is an aspirational goal for the neuroscience community. However
              so far this goal has been elusive due to the difficulties pointed
              to above and real integration is lacking.We have solved this
              problem in its full generality by developing and implementing a
              rigorous, generative framework, that learns unknown mappings
              between contrast mechanisms from data and infers missing data.
              The key idea in the framework is to minimize the difference
              between synthetic image volumes and real data over function
              classes of non-parametric mappings, including a diffeomorphic
              mapping, the contrast map and locations and types of missing
              data/non-reference signals. The non-parametric mappings are
              instantiated as regularized but over-parameterized functional
              forms over spatial grids. A final, manual refinement step is
              included to ensure scientific quality of the results.Our
              framework permits rigorous quantification of the local metric
              distortions between different individual brains, which is
              important for quantitative joint analysis of data gathered in
              multiple animals. Existing methods for atlas mapping do not
              provide metric quantifications and analyses of the resulting
              individual variations. We apply this pipeline to data modalities
              including various combinations of in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI, 3D STP
              and fMOST data sets, 2D serial histology sections including a 3D
              reassembly step, and brains processed for snRNAseq with tissue
              partially removed. Median local linear scale change with respect
              to a histologically processed Nissl reference brain, as measured
              using the Jacobian of the diffeomorphic transformations, was
              found to be 0.93 for STPT imaged brains (7\% shrinkage) and 0.84
              for fMOST imaged brains (16\% shrinkage between reference brains
              and imaged volumes). Shrinkage between in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI
              for a mouse brain was found to be 0.96, and the distortion
              between the perfused brain and tape-cut digital sections was
              shown to be minimal (1.02 for Nissl histology sections). We were
              able to quantitatively characterize the individual variation in
              shape across individuals by studying variations in the tangent
              space of the diffeomorphic transformation around the reference
              brain. Based on this work we are able to establish co-variation
              patterns in metric distortions across the entire brain, across a
              large population set. We note that the magnitude of individual
              variation is often greater than differences between different
              sample preparation techniques. Our work establishes a
              quantitative, scalable and streamlined workflow for unifying a
              broad spectrum of multi-modal whole-brain light microscopic data
              volumes into a coordinate-based atlas framework, a step that is a
              prerequisite for large scale integration of whole brain data sets
              in modern neuroscience.",

  abstract = "SUMMARY The isocortex and hippocampal formation are two major
              structures in the mammalian brain that play critical roles in
              perception, cognition, emotion and learning. Both structures
              contain multiple regions, for many of which the cellular
              composition is still poorly understood. In this study, we used
              two complementary single-cell RNA-sequencing approaches,
              SMART-Seq and 10x, to profile ∼1.2 million cells covering all
              regions in the adult mouse isocortex and hippocampal formation,
              and derived a cell type taxonomy comprising 379 transcriptomic
              types. The completeness of coverage enabled us to define gene
              expression variations across the entire spatial landscape without
              significant gaps. We found that cell types are organized in a
              hierarchical manner and exhibit varying degrees of discrete or
              continuous relatedness with each other. Such molecular
              relationships correlate strongly with the spatial distribution
              patterns of the cell types, which can be region-specific, or
              shared across multiple regions, or part of one or more gradients
              along with other cell types. Glutamatergic neuron types have much
              greater diversity than GABAergic neuron types, both molecularly
              and spatially, and they define regional identities as well as
              inter-region relationships. For example, we found that
              glutamatergic cell types between the isocortex and hippocampal
              formation are highly distinct from each other yet possess shared
              molecular signatures and corresponding layer specificities,
              indicating their homologous relationships. Overall, our study
              establishes a molecular architecture of the mammalian isocortex
              and hippocampal formation for the first time, and begins to shed
              light on its underlying relationship with the development,

              that selectively make connections within the cortex and other
              telencephalic structures. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of

              experimental conditions, genotypes or phenotypes through
              differential expression analysis has long been the cornerstone of
              transcriptomic analysis. Single cell RNA-seq is revolutionizing
              transcriptomics and is enabling interindividual differential gene
              expression analysis and identification of genetic variants
              associated with gene expression, so called expression
              quantitative trait loci at cell-type resolution. Current methods
              for power analysis and guidance of experimental design either do
              not account for the specific characteristics of single cell data
              or are not suitable to model interindividual comparisons. Results
              Here we present a statistical framework for experimental design
              and power analysis of single cell differential gene expression
              between groups of individuals and expression quantitative trait
              locus analysis. The model relates sample size, number of cells
              per individual and sequencing depth to the power of detecting
              differentially expressed genes within individual cell types.
              Power analysis is based on data driven priors from literature or
              pilot experiments across a wide range of application scenarios
              and single cell RNA-seq platforms. Using these priors we show
              that, for a fixed budget, the number of cells per individual is
              the major determinant of power. Conclusion Our model is general
              and allows for systematic comparison of alternative experimental
              designs and can thus be used to guide experimental design to
              optimize power. For a wide range of applications, shallow
              sequencing of high numbers of cells per individual leads to
              higher overall power than deep sequencing of fewer cells. The

              fundamental question in neuroscience and motivates the generation
              of taxonomies based on electrophysiological, morphological and
              molecular single cell properties. Establishing the correspondence
              across data modalities and understanding the underlying
              principles has proven challenging. Bio-realistic computational
              models offer the ability to probe cause-and-effect and have
              historically been used to explore phenomena at the single-neuron
              level. Here we introduce a computational optimization workflow
              used for the generation and evaluation of more than 130 million
              single neuron models with active conductances. These models were
              based on 230 in vitro electrophysiological experiments followed
              by morphological reconstruction from the mouse visual cortex. We
              show that distinct ion channel conductance vectors exist that
              distinguish between major cortical classes with passive and
              h-channel conductances emerging as particularly important for
              classification. Next, using models of genetically defined
              classes, we show that differences in specific conductances
              predicted from the models reflect differences in gene expression
              in excitatory and inhibitory cell types as experimentally
              validated by single-cell RNA-sequencing. The differences in these
              conductances, in turn, explain many of the electrophysiological
              differences observed between cell types. Finally, we show the
              robustness of the herein generated single-cell models as
              representations and realizations of specific cell types in face
              of biological variability and optimization complexity. Our
              computational effort generated models that reconcile major
              single-cell data modalities that define cell types allowing for
              causal relationships to be examined. Highlights 1. Generation and
              evaluation of more than 130 million single-cell models with
              active conductances along the reconstructed morphology faithfully
              recapitulate the electrophysiology of 230 in vitro experiments.
              2. Optimized ion channel conductances along the cellular
              morphology (`all-active') are characteristic of model complexity
              and offer enhanced biophysical realism. 3. Ion channel
              conductance vectors of all-active models classify
              transcriptomically defined cell-types. 4. Cell type differences
              in ion channel conductances predicted by the models correlate
              with experimentally measured single-cell gene expression

              Single-cell RNA sequencing provides a powerful approach to
              identify cell types based on their gene expression profiles and
              has revealed many distinct cell populations in the
              brain[1][1]-[3][2]. Single-cell epigenomic profiling[4][3],[5][4]
              further provides information on gene-regulatory signatures of
              different cell types. Understanding how different cell types
              contribute to brain function, however, requires knowledge of
              their spatial organization and connectivity, which is not
              preserved in sequencing-based methods that involve cell
              dissociation[3][2],[6][5]. Here, we used an in situ single-cell
              transcriptome-imaging method, multiplexed error-robust
              fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH)[7][6], to generate a
              molecularly defined and spatially resolved cell atlas of the
              mouse primary motor cortex (MOp). We profiled ∼300,000 cells in
              the MOp, identified 95 neuronal and non-neuronal cell clusters,
              and revealed a complex spatial map in which not only excitatory
              neuronal clusters but also most inhibitory neuronal clusters
              adopted layered organizations. Notably, intratelencephalic (IT)
              cells, the largest branch of neurons in the MOp, formed a
              continuous spectrum of cells with gradual changes in both gene
              expression profiles and cortical depth positions in a highly
              correlated manner. Furthermore, we integrated MERFISH with
              retrograde tracing to probe the projection targets for different
              MOp neuronal cell types and found that projections of MOp neurons
              to other cortical regions formed a many-to-many network with each
              target region receiving input preferentially from a different
              composition of IT clusters. Overall, our results provide a
              high-resolution spatial and projection map of molecularly defined

              transcriptomic analyses of the two main cortical neuronal
              subtypes, glutamatergic projection neurons and GABAergic
              interneurons, in human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque. Using
              genome-wide profiling of the H3K27ac histone modification, we
              identify neuron-subtype-specific regulatory elements that
              previously went undetected in bulk brain tissue samples.
              Human-specific regulatory changes are uncovered in multiple
              genes, including those associated with language, autism spectrum
              disorder and drug addiction. We observe preferential evolutionary
              divergence in neuron-subtype-specific regulatory elements and
              show that a substantial fraction of pan-neuronal regulatory
              elements undergo subtype-specific evolutionary changes. This

              resource for further exploration of human brain evolution and
              function. SIGNIFICANCE The cerebral cortex of the human brain is
              a highly complex, heterogeneous tissue that contains many cell
              types which are exquisitely regulated at the level of gene
              expression by non-coding regulatory elements, presumably, in a
              cell-type-dependent manner. However, assessing the regulatory
              elements in individual cell types is technically challenging, and
              therefore, most of the previous studies on gene regulation were
              performed with bulk brain tissue. Here we analyze two major types
              of neurons isolated from the cerebral cortex of humans,
              chimpanzees and rhesus macaques, and report complex patterns of
              cell-type-specific evolution of the regulatory elements in
              numerous genes. Many genes with evolving regulation are

              regulatory programs with broader tissue distribution and greater

              capacity to model complex differentiation landscapes. Thus,
              contemporary methods cannot predict how cells evolve
              stochastically and in physical time from an arbitrary starting
              expression state, nor can they model the cell fate consequences
              of gene expression perturbations. We introduce PRESCIENT
              (Potential eneRgy undErlying Single Cell gradIENTs), a generative
              modeling framework that learns an underlying differentiation
              landscape from single-cell time-series gene expression data. Our
              generative model framework provides insight into the process of
              differentiation and can simulate differentiation trajectories for
              arbitrary gene expression progenitor states. We validate our
              method on a recently published experimental lineage tracing
              dataset that provides observed trajectories. We show that this
              model is able to predict the fate biases of progenitor cells in
              neutrophil/macrophage lineages when accounting for cell
              proliferation, improving upon the best performing existing

              to addiction-associated traits lie largely in non-coding regions
              of the genome, likely disrupting cis-regulatory element (CRE)
              function. CREs tend to be highly cell type-specific and may
              contribute to the functional development of the neural circuits
              underlying addiction. Yet, a systematic approach for predicting
              the impact of risk variants on the CREs of specific cell
              populations is lacking. To dissect the cell types and brain
              regions underlying addiction-associated traits, we applied LD
              score regression to compare GWAS to genomic regions collected
              from human and mouse assays for open chromatin, which is
              associated with CRE activity. We found enrichment of

              prefrontal cortical areas and striatal regions known to play
              major roles in reward and addiction. To further dissect the cell
              type-specific basis of addiction-associated traits, we also
              identified enrichments in human orthologs of open chromatin
              regions of mouse neuronal subtypes: cortical excitatory, D1, D2,

              cell type-specific regions of open chromatin to further dissect
              human NeuN+ open chromatin regions into cortical excitatory or
              striatal D1 and D2 neurons and predict the functional impact of
              addiction-associated genetic variants. Our results suggest that
              different neuronal subtypes within the reward system play
              distinct roles in the variety of traits that contribute to
              addiction. Significance Statement We combine statistical genetic
              and machine learning techniques to find that the predisposition
              to for nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis use behaviors can be
              partially explained by genetic variants in conserved regulatory

              neuroinformatics tools, we delineated the MOp-ul within the Mouse

              collective knowledge and understanding of brain cell type

              genetic landscape of cortical cell types that congruently

              play a central role in regulating the spatial-temporal gene
              expression program of multi-cellular organism. cREs are
              characterized by the presence of accessible (or open) chromatin,
              which can be identified at genome-wide scale with assays such as
              ATAC-seq, DHS-seq, and FAIRE-seq. However, it remains technically
              challenging to comprehensively identify the long-range physical
              interactions that occur between cREs, especially in a cost
              effective manner using low-input samples. Here, we report HiCAR
              (High-throughput Chromosome conformation capture on Accessible
              DNA with mRNA-seq co-assay), a method that enables simultaneous
              assessment of cis-regulatory chromatin interactions and chromatin
              accessibility, as well as evaluation of the transcriptome, which
              represents the functional output of chromatin structure and
              accessibility. Unlike immunoprecipitation-based methods such as
              HiChIP, PLAC-seq, and ChIA-PET, HiCAR does not require
              target-specific antibodies and thus can comprehensively capture
              the cis-regulatory chromatin contacts anchored at accessible
              regulatory DNA regions and associated with diverse epigenetic
              modifications and transcription factor binding. Compared to
              Trac-looping, another method designed to capture interactions
              between accessible chromatin regions, HiCAR produced a 17-fold
              greater yield of informative long-range cis- reads at a similar
              sequencing depth and required 1,000-fold fewer cells as input.
              Applying HiCAR to H1 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) revealed
              46,792 cis-regulatory chromatin interactions at 5kb resolution.
              Interestingly, we found that epigenetically poised, bivalent, and
              repressed cREs exhibit comparable spatial interaction activity to
              those transcriptionally activated cREs. Using machine learning
              approaches, we predicated 22 epigenome features that are
              potentially important for the spatial interaction activity of
              cREs in H1 hESC. Lastly, we also identified long-range
              cis-regulatory chromatin interactions in GM12878 and mouse
              embryonic stem cells with HiCAR. Our results demonstrate that

              modalities in the same single cell, a task that has been
              difficult to accomplish with existing tools. Here, we report the
              direct super-resolution imaging of over 3,660 chromosomal loci in
              single mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) by DNA seqFISH+, along
              with 17 chromatin marks by sequential immunofluorescence (IF) and
              the expression profile of 70 RNAs, in the same cells. We
              discovered that the nucleus is separated into zones defined by
              distinct combinatorial chromatin marks. DNA loci and nascent
              transcripts are enriched at the interfaces between specific
              nuclear zones, and the level of gene expression correlates with
              an association between active or nuclear speckle zones. Our
              analysis also uncovered several distinct mESCs subpopulations

              levels of some chromatin marks, such as H3K27me3 and macroH2A1
              (mH2A1), are heritable over at least 3-4 generations, whereas
              other marks fluctuate on a faster time scale. The long-lived

              the DNA adhered onto the biochip is directly contacted by a

              single-cell multi-omics sequencing to develop a theoretical

              sequence onto a description of the emergent spatial dynamics in

              and in vivo we exemplify our approach in the context of exit from
              pluripotency and global de novo methylation of the genome. We
              show how DNA methylation patterns of the embryonic genome are
              established through the interplay between spatially correlated
              DNA methylation and topological changes to the DNA. This feedback
              leads to the predicted formation of 30-40nm sized condensates of
              methylated DNA and determines genome-scale DNA methylation rates.
              We verify these findings with orthogonal single cell multi-omics

              beginning to be addressed. Here we conditionally ablate Rad21 in

              expression of genes that facilitate neuronal maturation,
              homeostasis, and activation. In agreement with recent reports,
              activity-dependent genes were downregulated at baseline. However,

              activity-dependent gene expression to a role for cohesin and CTCF

              inducibility of activity-dependent gene expression is linked to

              networks. ScATAC-seq combined with single-cell RNA sequencing

              as novel cell-type specific activation of enhancer and
              transcription factor binding sites as well as chromatin changes
              specific to cell states. On the other hand, scATAC-seq data is
              known to be challenging to interpret due to its high number of
              zeros as well as the heterogeneity derived from different
              protocols. Because of the stochastic lack of marker gene
              activities, cell type identification by scATAC-seq remains
              difficult even at a cluster level. Results In this study, we

              scRNA-seq datasets to define existing cell types and uncover the
              genomic regions which drive cell-type specific gene regulation.
              To investigate the robustness of existing cell-typing methods, we
              collected 7 scATAC-seq datasets targeting mouse brain for a
              meta-analytic comparison of neuronal cell-type annotation,
              including a reference atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative
              Cell Census Network (BICCN). By comparing the area under the
              receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROCs) for the three
              major cell types (inhibitory, excitatory, and non-neuronal
              cells), cell-typing performance by single markers is found to be
              highly variable even for known marker genes due to study-specific
              biases. How-ever, the signal aggregation of a large and redundant
              marker gene set, optimized via multiple scRNA-seq data, achieves
              the highest cell-typing performances among 5 existing marker gene
              sets, from the individual cell to cluster level. That gene set
              also shows a high consistency with the cluster-specific genes
              from inhibitory subtypes in two well-annotated datasets,
              suggesting applicability to rare cell types. Next, we demonstrate
              a comprehensive assessment of scATAC-seq cell typing using
              exhaustive combinations of the marker gene sets with supervised
              learning methods including machine learning classifiers and joint
              clustering methods. Our results show that the combinations using
              robust marker gene sets systematically ranked at the top, not
              only with model based prediction using a large reference data but
              also with a simple summation of expression strengths across
              markers. To demonstrate the utility of this robust cell typing
              approach, we trained a deep neural network to predict chromatin
              accessibility in each subtype using only DNA sequence. Through
              model interpretation methods, we identify key motifs enriched
              about robust gene sets for each neuronal subtype. Conclusions
              Through the meta-analytic evaluation of scATACseq cell-typing
              methods, we develop a novel method set to exploit the BICCN
              reference atlas. Our study strongly supports the value of robust
              marker gene selection as a feature selection tool and
              cross-dataset comparison between scATAC-seq datasets to improve
              alignment of scATAC-seq to known biology. With this novel, high
              quality epigenetic data, genomic analysis of regulatory regions

              NLGN1 are expressed in the epithelial luminal, basal and
              neuroendocrine cells, as well as the immune, endothelial and

              diverging, tree-like branching pattern, but the opposite can
              occur when distinct progenitors contribute to the same cell type.
              During this convergent differentiation, it is unknown if cells
              ``remember'' their origins transcriptionally or whether this
              influences cell behavior. Most coronary blood vessels of the
              heart develop from two different progenitor sources---the
              endocardium (Endo) and sinus venosus (SV)---but whether
              transcriptional or functional differences related to origin are
              retained is unknown. We addressed this by combining lineage
              tracing with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in embryonic
              and adult mouse hearts. Shortly after coronary development
              begins, capillary ECs transcriptionally segregated into two
              states that retained progenitor-specific gene expression. Later
              in development, when the coronary vasculature is well-established
              but still remodeling, capillary ECs again segregated into two
              populations, but transcriptional differences were related to
              tissue localization rather than lineage. Specifically, ECs in the
              heart septum expressed genes indicative of increased local
              hypoxia and decreased blood flow. Adult capillary ECs were more
              homogeneous and lacked indications of either lineage or location.
              In agreement, SV- and Endo-derived ECs in adult hearts displayed
              similar responses to injury. Finally, scRNAseq of developing
              human coronary vessels indicated that the human heart followed
              similar principles. Thus, over the course of development,
              transcriptional heterogeneity in coronary ECs is first influenced
              by lineage, then by location, until heterogeneity disappears in
              the homeostatic adult heart. These results highlight the
              plasticity of ECs during development, and the validity of the
              mouse as a model for human coronary development. \#\#\# Competing

              multiplexed error-robust FISH, revealing a high level of cell
              heterogeneity in this brain region. We show that the
              transcriptional and spatial diversity of neuron subtypes underlie
              NAc's anatomic and functional heterogeneity, and possibly
              contribute to the pathogenesis of different neurological

              neuronal composition of the NAc achieves its highly heterogenous
              structure and diverse functions. Collectively, our study
              generates a spatially resolved cell taxonomy for understanding
              the NAc structure and function, which demonstrates the importance

              state, but that this diversity is organized by a single factor:
              position along their main axis of transcriptomic variation. We
              combined in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of mouse V1 with a
              novel transcriptomic method to identify mRNAs for 72 selected
              genes in ex vivo slices. We used transcriptomic clusters to
              classify inhibitory neurons imaged in layers 1-3 using a
              three-level hierarchy of 5 Families, 11 Classes, and 35
              Subclasses. Visual responses differed significantly only across
              Families, but modulation by brain state differed at all three
              hierarchical levels. Nevertheless, this diversity could be
              predicted from the first transcriptomic principal component,
              which predicted a cell type's brain state modulation and
              correlations with simultaneously recorded cells. Inhibitory
              Subclasses with narrower spikes, lower input resistance, weaker
              adaptation, and less axon in layer 1 as determined in vitro fired
              more in resting, oscillatory brain states. Subclasses with the
              opposite properties fired more during arousal. The former cells
              had more inhibitory cholinergic receptors, and the latter more
              excitatory receptors. Thus, despite the diversity of V1
              inhibitory neurons, a simple principle determines how their joint

              spermatogenesis evolve rapidly in mammals, presumably due to the
              evolutionary pressure on males to be reproductively successful.
              The rapid evolution of the testis was shown to be reflected at
              the molecular level based on bulk-tissue work, but the molecular
              evolution of individual spermatogenic cell types across mammalian
              lineages remains largely uncharacterized. Here we report
              evolutionary analyses of single-nucleus transcriptome data for
              testes from eleven species that cover the three major mammalian
              lineages (eutherians, marsupials, egg-laying monotremes) and
              birds (the evolutionary outgroup), and include seven key
              primates. Our analyses reveal that the rapid evolution of the
              testis is driven by accelerated fixation rates of gene expression
              changes, amino acid altering substitutions, and newly emerged
              genes in late spermatogenic stages - likely facilitated by
              reduced pleiotropic constraints, haploid selection, and a
              transcriptionally permissive chromatin environment. We identify
              temporal expression changes of individual genes across species,
              which may have contributed to the emergence of species-specific
              phenotypes, but also conserved expression programs underlying
              ancestral spermatogenic processes. Sex chromosome analyses show
              that genes predominantly expressed in spermatogonia (i.e., germ
              cells fueling spermatogenesis) and Sertoli cells (i.e., somatic
              supporting cells) independently accumulated on X chromosomes
              across mammals during evolution, presumably due to
              male-beneficial selective forces. Further work uncovered that the
              process of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) also occurs
              in monotremes and hence is common to the different mammalian sex
              chromosome systems, contrary to previous inferences. Thus, the
              general mechanism of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin
              (MSUC), which underlies MSCI, represents an ancestral mammalian
              feature. Together, our study illuminates the cellular and
              molecular evolution of mammalian spermatogenesis and associated
              selective forces, and provides a resource for investigating the

              its expression. Insertion of various combinations of CTCF motifs
              between Sox2 and its distal enhancers generated ectopic loops
              with varying degrees of insulation that directly correlated with
              reduced transcriptional output. Yet, even the mutants exhibiting
              the strongest insulation, with six CTCF motifs in divergent

              The diversity of cell types is a challenge to the precise
              quantification of aging and its reversal. Here we develop a suite
              of 'aging clocks' based on single cell transcriptomic data to
              characterize cell type-specific aging and rejuvenation
              strategies. The subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenic region
              contains many cell types and provides an excellent system to
              study cell-level tissue aging and regeneration. We generated
              21,458 single-cell transcriptomes from the neurogenic regions of
              28 mice, tiling ages from young to old. With these data, we
              trained a suite of single cell-based regression models (aging
              clocks) to predict both chronological age (passage of time) and
              biological age (fitness, in this case the proliferative capacity
              of the neurogenic region). Both types of clocks perform well on
              independent cohorts of mice. Genes underlying the single
              cell-based aging clocks are mostly cell-type specific, but also
              include a few shared genes in the interferon and lipid metabolism
              pathways. We used these single cell-based aging clocks to measure
              transcriptomic rejuvenation, by generating single cell RNA-seq
              datasets of SVZ neurogenic regions for two interventions -
              heterochronic parabiosis (young blood) and exercise.
              Interestingly, the use of aging clocks reveals that both
              heterochronic parabiosis and exercise reverse transcriptomic
              aging in the niche, but in different ways across cell types and
              genes. This study represents the first development of
              high-resolution aging clocks from single cell transcriptomic data

              consideration for performing Perturb-seq experiments is
              uncoupling of barcodes from linked sgRNA expression cassettes,
              which can occur during lentiviral transduction of co-packaged

              single-cell resolution. The resulting datasets are quite large
              (with scales of TB/hour in some cases), which has presented a
              barrier to routine open sharing of this data, slowing progress in
              reproducible research. State of the art methods for analyzing
              this data are based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF);
              these approaches solve a non-convex optimization problem, and are
              highly effective when good initializations are available, but can
              break down e.g. in low-SNR settings where common initialization
              approaches fail.Here we introduce an improved approach to
              compressing and denoising functional imaging data. The method is
              based on a spatially-localized penalized matrix decomposition
              (PMD) of the data to separate (low-dimensional) signal from
              (temporally-uncorrelated) noise. This approach can be applied in
              parallel on local spatial patches and is therefore highly
              scalable, does not impose non-negativity constraints or require
              stringent identifiability assumptions (leading to significantly
              more robust results compared to NMF), and estimates all
              parameters directly from the data, so no hand-tuning is required.
              We have applied the method to a wide range of functional imaging
              data (including one-photon, two-photon, three-photon, widefield,
              somatic, axonal, dendritic, calcium, and voltage imaging
              datasets): in all cases, we observe ~2-4x increases in SNR and
              compression rates of 20-300x with minimal visible loss of signal,
              with no adjustment of hyperparameters; this in turn facilitates
              the process of demixing the observed activity into contributions
              from individual neurons. We focus on two challenging
              applications: dendritic calcium imaging data and voltage imaging
              data in the context of optogenetic stimulation. In both cases, we
              show that our new approach leads to faster and much more robust

              The presence of doublets can lead to spurious biological

              DoubletFinder infers the putative gene expression profile of real

              difficult to train statistical models for their identification
              properly. Instead, postulated patterns of genomic features have
              been used heuristically for identification. The development of

              often heterogeneous, sample collections requires a way of
              identifying and tracking recurrent cell subpopulations across the
              entire collection. Here we describe a flexible approach, called
              Conos (Clustering On Network Of Samples), that relies on multiple
              plausible inter-sample mappings to construct a global graph
              connecting all measured cells. The graph can then be used to
              propagate information between samples and to identify cell

              $\alpha$2 adrenergic agonist clonidine. The $\alpha$2 antagonist
              idazoxan increased spike frequency, suggesting tonic NE-mediated
              inhibition. The NE-induced current was inwardly rectified, and
              the reversal potential was dependent on external potassium
              concentration; it was blocked by barium in the bath and by
              GTP-$\gamma$-S in the pipette, suggesting activation of a
              G-protein inward rectifying K+ (GIRK) current. NE and clonidine
              decreased calcium currents evoked by depolarizing voltage steps.
              The selective $\alpha$1 adrenergic agonist phenylephrine had no
              effect on membrane potential but did increase IPSC frequency;
              miniature IPSC frequency was also increased, in some cells

              presynaptic action at $\alpha$1 receptors on GABAergic axons that
              innervate hypocretin neurons. NE therefore inhibits hypocretin
              neurons directly through two mechanisms: activation of a GIRK
              current, depression of calcium currents, and indirectly through
              increased inhibitory GABA input. Similar to NE, dopamine and
              epinephrine reduced or blocked spikes and, in the presence of
              TTX, showed direct hyperpolarizing actions. The action of
              dopamine was blocked by the D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride,
              whereas a D1/5 antagonist had no effect. These data suggest that
              catecholamines evoke strong inhibitory actions on hypocretin

              major cell types: D1 (dopamine receptor 1) and D2 (dopamine
              receptor 2) expressing spiny projection neurons (SPNs). We
              generated a cell type atlas of the adult murine striatum using
              single-cell RNA-seq of SPNs combined with quantitative RNA in
              situ hybridization (ISH). We developed a novel computational
              pipeline that distinguishes discrete versus continuous cell
              identities in scRNA-seq data, and used it to show that SPNs in
              the striatum can be classified into four discrete types that
              reside in discrete anatomical clusters or are spatially
              intermingled. Within each discrete type, we find multiple
              independent axes of continuous cell identity that map to spatial
              gradients and whose genes are conserved between discrete types.
              These gradients correlate well to previously-mapped gradients of
              connectivity. Using these insights, we discovered multiple novel
              spatially localized region of the striatum, one of which contains
              patch-D2 SPNs that express Tac1, Htr7, and Th. Intriguingly, we
              found one subtype that strongly co-expresses both D1 and D2
              dopamine receptors, and uniquely expresses a rare D2 receptor
              splice variant. These results collectively suggest an
              organizational principal of neuron identity in which major neuron
              types can be separated into discrete classes with little overlap
              and no implied spatial relationship. However these discrete
              classes are then continuously subdivided by multiple spatial
              gradients of expression defining anatomical location via a
              combinatorial mechanism. Finally, they suggest that neuronal
              circuitry has a substructure at far higher resolution than is
              typically interrogated which is defined by the precise identity
              and location of a neuron.",

              gene regulation and a host of other nuclear processes. Many
              recent insights into 3D chromatin structure across species and
              cell types have contributed to our understanding of the
              principles governing chromatin looping. However, 3D genome
              evolution and how it relates to Mendelian selection remain
              largely unexplored. CTCF, an insulator protein found at most loop
              anchors, has been described as the ``master weaver'' of mammalian
              genomes, and variations in CTCF occupancy are known to influence
              looping divergence. A large fraction of mammalian CTCF binding
              sites fall within transposable elements (TEs) but their
              contributions to looping variation are unknown. Here we

              regions, up to the entire human genome. These advances
              necessitate a reliable processing pipeline and peak-calling
              algorithm. Most STARR-seq studies have relied on chromatin
              immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) processing pipeline to
              identify peaks. However, there are key differences in STARR-seq
              versus ChIP-seq data: STARR-seq uses transcribed RNA to measure
              enhancer activity, making determining the basal transcription
              rate important. Furthermore, STARR-seq coverage is non-uniform,
              overdispersed, and often confounded by sequencing biases such as
              GC content and mappability. Moreover, here, we observed a clear
              correlation between RNA thermodynamic stability and STARR-seq
              readout, suggesting that STARR-seq might be sensitive to RNA

              fundamentally new approach -- microfluidic Deterministic
              Barcoding in Tissue for spatial omics sequencing (DBiT-seq).
              Parallel microfluidic channels (10$\mu$m, 25$\mu$m, or 50$\mu$m
              in width) are used to deliver molecular barcodes to the surface
              of a formaldehyde fixed tissue slide in a spatially confined
              manner. Crossflow of two sets of barcodes A1-A50 and B1-B50
              followed by ligation in situ yields a 2D mosaic of tissue pixels,
              each containing a unique combination of full barcode AiBj
              (i=1-50, j=1-50). It permits simultaneous barcoding of mRNAs,
              proteins, or even other omics on a fixed tissue slide, enabling
              the construction of a high-spatial-resolution multi-omics atlas
              by NGS sequencing. Applying it to mouse embryo tissues revealed
              all major tissue types in early organogenesis, distinguished
              brain microvascular networks, discovered new developmental
              patterning in forebrain, and demonstrated the ability to detect a
              single-cell-layer of melanocytes lining an optical vesicle and
              asymmetric expression of Rorb and Aldh1a1 within it, presumably

              Automated feature identification using spatial differential

              interpret sensory information, plan and organize tasks, and to
              control motor functions. The mature cerebral cortex is a modular

              DNA in the eukaryotic cell is in nucleosomes and thereby occluded
              by histones, and can be further occluded by higher-order
              chromatin structures and repressor complexes. Indeed, genome-wide
              location analyses have revealed that, for all transcription
              factors tested, the vast majority of potential DNA-binding sites
              are unoccupied, demonstrating the inaccessibility of most of the

              silent genes become bound de novo by transcription factors,
              thereby initiating regulatory events in chromatin. Binding
              cooperativity can be sufficient for many kinds of factors to
              simultaneously engage a target site in chromatin and activate
              gene expression. However, in cases in which the binding of a
              series of factors is sequential in time and thus not initially
              cooperative, special ``pioneer transcription factors'' can be the
              first to engage target sites in chromatin. Such initial binding
              can passively enhance transcription by reducing the number of
              additional factors that are needed to bind the DNA, culminating

              open up the local chromatin and directly make it competent for

              its occupancy is lost in parallel with loop decommissioning

              cell-type-specific open chromatin data set to date. Using the
              Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin followed by sequencing
              (ATAC-seq), we created maps of chromatin accessibility in two
              cell types (neurons and non-neurons) across 14 distinct brain
              regions of five individuals. Chromatin structure varies markedly
              by cell type, with neuronal chromatin displaying higher regional

              Such methods were limited by the introduction of in vitro noise

              we characterized to be approximately 10-100$\times$ higher than

              epigenetic mark that has been most highly studied is DNA
              methylation, the presence of methyl groups at CpG dinucleotides.
              These dinucleotides are often located near gene promoters and
              associate with gene expression levels. Early studies indicated
              that global levels of DNA methylation increase over the first few
              years of life and then decrease beginning in late adulthood.
              Recently, with the advent of microarray and next-generation
              sequencing technologies, increases in variability of DNA
              methylation with age have been observed, and a number of
              site-specific patterns have been identified. It has also been
              shown that certain CpG sites are highly associated with age, to
              the extent that prediction models using a small number of these
              sites can accurately predict the chronological age of the donor.
              Together, these observations point to the existence of two
              phenomena that both contribute to age-related DNA methylation
              changes: epigenetic drift and the epigenetic clock. In this
              review, we focus on healthy human aging throughout the lifetime
              and discuss the dynamics of DNA methylation as well as how
              interactions between the genome, environment, and the epigenome
              influence aging rates. We also discuss the impact of determining
              'epigenetic age' for human health and outline some important
              caveats to existing and future studies.",

              model such a system, the abundance of each activated protein
              species can be described as a stochastic function of the
              abundance of other proteins. High-dimensional single-cell
              technologies, such as mass cytometry, offer an opportunity to
              characterize signaling circuit-wide. However, the challenge of
              developing and applying computational approaches to interpret
              such complex data remains. Here, we developed computational
              methods, based on established statistical concepts, to
              characterize signaling network relationships by quantifying the
              strengths of network edges and deriving signaling response
              functions. In comparing signaling between na{\"\i}ve and
              antigen-exposed CD4(+) T lymphocytes, we find that although these
              two cell subtypes had similarly wired networks, na{\"\i}ve cells
              transmitted more information along a key signaling cascade than
              did antigen-exposed cells. We validated our characterization on
              mice lacking the extracellular-regulated mitogen-activated

              enhancer activity. Multiple tiers of enhancer suboptimization
              produce specific, but weak, patterns of expression, and we

              INTRODUCTION Human genetic studies have revealed long lists of
              genes and loci associated with risk for many diseases and
              disorders, but to systematically evaluate their phenotypic
              effects remains challenging. Without any a priori knowledge,
              these risk genes could affect any cellular processes in any cell
              type or tissue, which creates an enormous search space for
              identifying possible downstream effects. New high-throughput
              approaches are needed to functionally dissect these large gene
              sets across a spectrum of cell types in vivo. \#\#\# RATIONALE
              Analysis of trio-based whole-exome sequencing has implicated a
              large number of de novo loss-of-function variants that contribute
              to autism spectrum disorder and developmental delay (ASD/ND)
              risk. Such de novo variants often have large effect sizes, thus
              providing a key entry point for mechanistic studies. We have
              developed in vivo Perturb-Seq to allow simultaneous assessment of
              the individual phenotypes of a panel of such risk genes in the
              context of the developing mouse brain. \#\#\# RESULTS Using
              CRISPR-Cas9, we introduced frameshift mutations in 35 ASD/ND risk
              genes in pools, within the developing mouse neocortex in utero,
              followed by single-cell transcriptomic analysis of perturbed
              cells from the early postnatal brain. We analyzed five broad cell
              classes---cortical projection neurons, cortical inhibitory
              neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia---and
              selected cells that had received only single perturbations. Using
              weighted gene correlation network analysis, we identified 14
              covarying gene modules that represent transcriptional programs
              expressed in different classes of cortical cells. These modules
              included both those affecting common biological processes across
              multiple cell subsets and others representing cell type--specific
              features restricted to certain subsets. We estimated the effect
              size of each perturbation on each of the 14 gene modules by
              fitting a joint linear regression model, estimating how module
              gene expression in cells from each perturbation group deviated
              from their expression level in internal control cells.
              Perturbations in nine ASD/ND genes had significant effects across
              five modules across four cell classes, including cortical
              projection neurons, cortical inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, and
              oligodendrocytes. Some of these results were validated by using a
              single-perturbation model as well as a germline-modified mutant
              mouse model. To establish whether the perturbation-associated
              gene modules identified in the mouse cerebral cortex are relevant
              to human biology and ASD/ND pathology, we performed co-analyses
              of data from ASD and control human brains and human cerebral
              organoids. Both gene expression and gene covariation
              (``modularity'') of several of the gene modules identified in the
              mouse Perturb-Seq analysis are conserved in human brain tissue.
              Comparison with single-cell data from ASD patients showed overlap
              in both affected cell types and transcriptomic phenotypes. \#\#\#
              CONCLUSION In vivo Perturb-Seq can serve as a scalable tool for
              systems genetic studies of large gene panels to reveal their
              cell-intrinsic functions at single-cell resolution in complex
              tissues. In this work, we demonstrated the application of in vivo
              Perturb-Seq to ASD/ND risk genes in the developing brain. This
              method can be applied across diverse diseases and tissues in the
              intact organism. ![Figure][3] In vivo Perturb-Seq identified
              neuron and glia-associated effects by perturbations of risk genes
              implicated in ASD/ND. De novo risk genes in this study were
              chosen from Satterstrom et al. (2018), and co-analysis with ASD
              patient data at bottom right is from Velmeshev et al. (2019);
              full citations for both are included in the full article online.
              The number of disease risk genes and loci identified through
              human genetic studies far outstrips the capacity to
              systematically study their functions. We applied a scalable
              genetic screening approach, in vivo Perturb-Seq, to functionally
              evaluate 35 autism spectrum disorder/neurodevelopmental delay
              (ASD/ND) de novo loss-of-function risk genes. Using CRISPR-Cas9,
              we introduced frameshift mutations in these risk genes in pools,
              within the developing mouse brain in utero, followed by
              single-cell RNA-sequencing of perturbed cells in the postnatal
              brain. We identified cell type--specific and evolutionarily
              conserved gene modules from both neuronal and glial cell classes.
              Recurrent gene modules and cell types are affected across this
              cohort of perturbations, representing key cellular effects across
              sets of ASD/ND risk genes. In vivo Perturb-Seq allows us to

               reference atlas of human cell types is a major goal for the
               field. Here, we set out to generate single-cell atlases of both
               gene expression (this study) and chromatin accessibility (Domcke
               et al. , this issue) using diverse human tissues obtained during
               midgestation. \#\#\# RATIONALE Contemporary knowledge of the
               molecular basis of in vivo human development mostly derives from
               a combination of human genetics, in vivo investigations of model
               organisms, and in vitro studies of differentiating human cell
               lines, rather than through direct investigations of developing
               human tissues. Several challenges have historically limited the
               study of developing human tissues at the molecular level,
               including limited access, tissue degradation, and cell type
               heterogeneity. For this and the companion study (Domcke et al. ,
               this issue), we were able to overcome these challenges. \#\#\#
               RESULTS We applied three-level single-cell combinatorial
               indexing for gene expression (sci-RNA-seq3) to 121 human fetal
               samples ranging from 72 to 129 days in estimated postconceptual
               age and representing 15 organs, altogether profiling 4 million
               single cells. We developed and applied a framework for
               quantifying cell type specificity, identifying 657 cell
               subtypes, which we preliminarily annotated based on
               cross-matching to mouse cell atlases. We identified and
               validated potentially circulating trophoblast-like and
               hepatoblast-like cells in unexpected tissues. Profiling gene
               expression in diverse tissues facilitated the cross-tissue
               analyses of broadly distributed cell types, including blood,
               endothelial, and epithelial cells. For blood cells, this yielded
               a multiorgan map of cell state trajectories from hematopoietic
               stem cells to all major sublineages. Multiple lines of evidence
               support the adrenal gland as a normal, albeit minor, site of
               erythropoiesis during fetal development. It was notably
               straightforward to integrate these human fetal data with a mouse
               embryonic cell atlas, despite differences in species and
               developmental stage. For some systems, this essentially
               permitted us to bridge gene expression dynamics from the
               embryonic to the fetal stages of mammalian development. \#\#\#
               CONCLUSION The single-cell data resource presented here is
               notable for its scale, its focus on human fetal development, the
               breadth of tissues analyzed, and the parallel generation of gene
               expression (this study) and chromatin accessibility data (Domcke
               et al. , this issue). We furthermore consolidate the technical
               framework for individual laboratories to generate and analyze
               gene expression and chromatin accessibility data from millions
               of single cells. Looking forward, we envision that the somewhat
               narrow window of midgestational human development studied here
               will be complemented by additional atlases of earlier and later
               time points, as well as similarly comprehensive profiling and
               integration of data from model organisms. The continued
               development and application of methods for ascertaining gene
               expression and chromatin accessibility---in concert with
               spatial, epigenetic, proteomic, lineage history, and other
               information---will be necessary to obtain a comprehensive view
               of the temporal unfolding of human cell type diversity that
               begins at the single-cell zygote. An interactive website
               facilitates the exploration of these freely available data by
               tissue, cell type, or gene ([descartes.brotmanbaty.org][3]).
               ![Figure][4] A human cell atlas of fetal gene expression enables
               the exploration of in vivo gene expression across diverse cell
               types. We used a three-level combinatorial indexing assay
               (sci-RNA-seq3) to profile gene expression in ~4,000,000 single
               cells from 15 fetal organs. This rich resource enables, for
               example, the identification and annotation of cell types,
               cross-tissue integration of broadly distributed cell types
               (e.g., blood, endothelial, and epithelial), and interspecies
               integration of mouse embryonic and human fetal cell atlases.
               PCR, polymerase chain reaction. The gene expression program
               underlying the specification of human cell types is of
               fundamental interest. We generated human cell atlases of gene
               expression and chromatin accessibility in fetal tissues. For
               gene expression, we applied three-level combinatorial indexing
               to >110 samples representing 15 organs, ultimately profiling ~4
               million single cells. We leveraged the literature and other
               atlases to identify and annotate hundreds of cell types and
               subtypes, both within and across tissues. Our analyses focused
               on organ-specific specializations of broadly distributed cell
               types (such as blood, endothelial, and epithelial), sites of
               fetal erythropoiesis (which notably included the adrenal gland),
               and integration with mouse developmental atlases (such as
               conserved specification of blood cells). These data represent a
               rich resource for the exploration of in vivo human gene

               INTRODUCTION DNA methylation is essential to mammalian
               development, and dysregulation can cause serious pathological
               conditions, including immunodeficiency-centromeric
               instability-facial anomalies syndrome (ICF) and microcephalic
               dwarfism. The DNMT and TET enzymes are responsible for the
               addition and removal of DNA methylation, but how they coordinate
               to regulate the methylation landscape remains a central
               question. Using a knockin DNA methylation reporter, we performed
               a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen in human embryonic stem cells
               (hESCs) to discover DNA methylation regulators. \#\#\# RATIONALE
               We focused on bivalent promoters, defined by the presence of
               both active (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) histone marks
               and typically occupied by Polycomb-repressive complexes 1 and 2
               (PRC1 and PRC2). In stem or progenitor cells, bivalent promoters
               are believed to maintain developmental regulators in a ``poised
               state'' ready for activation upon differentiation, and they are
               sensitive to DNA hypermethylation in dysfunctional cellular
               contexts such as cancer or aging. Creation of a knockin DNA
               methylation reporter line provided a singular opportunity to
               visualize epigenetic alterations otherwise ``invisible'' in
               terms of gene expression changes in the stem cell state. Using
               the bivalent PAX6 P0 promoter as a representative locus, we
               aimed to discover mechanisms that regulate DNA methylation at
               regions with similar chromatin features, which would inform not
               only gene regulation during development but also epigenetic
               dysregulation in disease. \#\#\# RESULTS Our screen successfully
               identified not only known methylation regulators such as TET1 ,
               TDG , and KDM2B but also functionally uncharacterized genes,
               including QSER1 . Like the TET proteins, QSER1 safeguards
               bivalent promoters and poised enhancers (marked by H3K4me1 but
               not H3K27ac) against hypermethylation. However, distinct from
               the more general protective effect of the TET proteins on
               regulatory regions, QSER1 preferentially protects broad
               PRC2-bound and H3K27me3-marked regions and DNA methylation
               valleys (DMVs). Also known as DNA methylation canyons, DMVs
               identify large ($\geq$5 kb) hypomethylated regions present in
               cells of many lineages and conserved across vertebrates. They
               are enriched with bivalent promoters, developmental genes, and
               transcription factors, including PAX6 and the HOX genes. QSER1
               and TET1 showed high correlation in genomic occupancy measured
               by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and both
               were high at DMVs, whereas the binding of de novo
               methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B was excluded in DMVs and
               relatively enriched in the flanking regions. Further proteomic
               and genomic analyses revealed that QSER1 and TET1 share many
               common interacting proteins, depend on each other for efficient
               recruitment to DNA, and cooperate to limit the encroachment of
               DNMT3A and DNMT3B in DMVs. In addition, deleting DNMT3B reversed
               the hypermethylation in QSER1 knockout (KO) hESCs. Furthermore,
               combined KO of QSER 1 and TET1 had a stronger impact on DNA
               methylation and gene expression than either single KO and
               resulted in a failure of hESC differentiation to PDX1+NKX6.1+
               pancreatic progenitors. \#\#\# CONCLUSION We show that QSER1
               cooperates with TET1 to safeguard transcriptional and
               developmental programs from DNMT3-mediated de novo methylation
               at important genomic loci, especially in DMVs and bivalent
               promoters where hypermethylation has been linked to
               developmental disorders and cancers. Our work provides
               mechanistic insight into the region-specific regulation of the
               TET pathway and highlights the utility of unbiased genome-wide
               screens and locus-specific epigenetic measurements, including,
               but not limited to, DNA methylation for probing the epigenetic
               regulatory mechanisms relevant to human health. ![Figure][3]
               QSER1 safeguards DNA methylation valleys from de novo
               methylation. A fluorescence reporter hESC line (indicated by the
               red outline for fluorescence) was generated to track DNA
               methylation levels of the PAX6 promoter region in a genome-scale
               CRISPR-Cas9 screen for regulators of DNA methylation. A top
               screen hit, QSER1, cooperates with TET1 to antagonize
               DNMT3-mediated de novo methylation (depicted by the purple
               shading) at DMVs. DNA methylation is essential to mammalian
               development, and dysregulation can cause serious pathological
               conditions. Key enzymes responsible for deposition and removal
               of DNA methylation are known, but how they cooperate to regulate
               the methylation landscape remains a central question. Using a
               knockin DNA methylation reporter, we performed a genome-wide
               CRISPR-Cas9 screen in human embryonic stem cells to discover DNA
               methylation regulators. The top screen hit was an
               uncharacterized gene, QSER1 , which proved to be a key guardian
               of bivalent promoters and poised enhancers of developmental
               genes, especially those residing in DNA methylation valleys (or
               canyons). We further demonstrate genetic and biochemical
               interactions of QSER1 and TET1, supporting their cooperation to
               safeguard transcriptional and developmental programs from
               DNMT3-mediated de novo methylation. [1]:

              for parsing how vision works at a fundamental level started
              approximately a decade ago, ushered in by the mouse's convenient
              size, relatively low cost, and, above all, amenability to genetic
              perturbations. In the course of that effort, a large cadre of new
              and powerful tools for in vivo labeling, monitoring, and
              manipulation of neurons were applied to this species. As a
              consequence, a significant body of work now exists on the
              architecture, function, and development of mouse central visual
              pathways. Excitingly, much of that work includes causal testing
              of the role of specific cell types and circuits in visual
              perception and behavior-something rare to find in studies of the

              deafness-causative MAP1B gene encoding a highly conserved
              microtubule-associated protein. Three novel heterozygous MAP1B
              mutations (c.4198A>G, p.1400S>G; c.2768T>C, p.923I>T; c.5512T>C,

              of nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss in 3 unrelated Chinese
              families. Here, we show that MAP1B is highly expressed in the
              spiral ganglion neurons in the mouse cochlea. Using otic sensory
              neuron-like cells, generated by pluripotent stem cells from
              patients carrying the MAP1B mutation and control subject, we
              demonstrated that the p.1400S>G mutation caused the reduced
              levels and deficient phosphorylation of MAP1B, which are involved
              in the microtubule stability and dynamics. Strikingly, otic
              sensory neuron-like cells exhibited disturbed dynamics of
              microtubules, axonal elongation, and defects in
              electrophysiological properties. Dysfunctions of these derived
              otic sensory neuron-like cells were rescued by genetically
              correcting MAP1B mutation using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.
              Involvement of MAP1B in hearing was confirmed by audiometric
              evaluation of Map1b heterozygous KO mice. These mutant mice
              displayed late-onset progressive sensorineural hearing loss that
              was more pronounced in the high frequencies. The spiral ganglion
              neurons isolated from Map1b mutant mice exhibited the deficient
              phosphorylation and disturbed dynamics of microtubules. Map1b
              deficiency yielded defects in the morphology and
              electrophysiology of spiral ganglion neurons, but it did not
              affect the morphologies of cochlea in mice. Therefore, our data

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A major goal of molecular biology is determining the
              mechanisms that control the transcription of genes. Motif
              Enrichment Analysis (MEA) seeks to determine which DNA-binding
              transcription factors control the transcription of a set of genes
              by detecting enrichment of known binding motifs in the genes'
              regulatory regions. Typically, the biologist specifies a set of
              genes believed to be co-regulated and a library of known
              DNA-binding models for transcription factors, and MEA determines
              which (if any) of the factors may be direct regulators of the
              genes. Since the number of factors with known DNA-binding models
              is rapidly increasing as a result of high-throughput
              technologies, MEA is becoming increasingly useful. In this paper,
              we explore ways to make MEA applicable in more settings, and
              evaluate the efficacy of a number of MEA approaches. RESULTS: We
              first define a mathematical framework for Motif Enrichment
              Analysis that relaxes the requirement that the biologist input a
              selected set of genes. Instead, the input consists of all
              regulatory regions, each labeled with the level of a biological
              signal. We then define and implement a number of motif enrichment
              analysis methods. Some of these methods require a user-specified
              signal threshold, some identify an optimum threshold in a
              data-driven way and two of our methods are threshold-free. We
              evaluate these methods, along with two existing methods (Clover
              and PASTAA), using yeast ChIP-chip data. Our novel threshold-free
              method based on linear regression performs best in our
              evaluation, followed by the data-driven PASTAA algorithm. The
              Clover algorithm performs as well as PASTAA if the user-specified
              threshold is chosen optimally. Data-driven methods based on three
              statistical tests-Fisher Exact Test, rank-sum test, and
              multi-hypergeometric test--perform poorly, even when the
              threshold is chosen optimally. These methods (and Clover) perform
              even worse when unrestricted data-driven threshold determination
              is used. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel, threshold-free linear regression
              method works well on ChIP-chip data. Methods using data-driven
              threshold determination can perform poorly unless the range of
              thresholds is limited a priori. The limits implemented in PASTAA,
              however, appear to be well-chosen. Our novel algorithms--AME

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Scientists routinely scan DNA sequences for
              transcription factor (TF) binding sites (TFBSs). Most of the
              available tools rely on position-specific scoring matrices
              (PSSMs) constructed from aligned binding sites. Because of the
              resolutions of assays used to obtain TFBSs, databases such as
              TRANSFAC, ORegAnno and PAZAR store unaligned variable-length DNA
              segments containing binding sites of a TF. These DNA segments
              need to be aligned to build a PSSM. While the TRANSFAC database
              provides scoring matrices for TFs, nearly 78\% of the TFs in the
              public release do not have matrices available. As work on TFBS
              alignment algorithms has been limited, it is highly desirable to
              have an alignment algorithm tailored to TFBSs. RESULTS: We
              designed a novel algorithm named LASAGNA, which is aware of the
              lengths of input TFBSs and utilizes position dependence. Results
              on 189 TFs of 5 species in the TRANSFAC database showed that our
              method significantly outperformed ClustalW2 and MEME. We further
              compared a PSSM method dependent on LASAGNA to an alignment-free
              TFBS search method. Results on 89 TFs whose binding sites can be
              located in genomes showed that our method is significantly more
              precise at fixed recall rates. Finally, we described
              LASAGNA-ChIP, a more sophisticated version for ChIP (Chromatin
              immunoprecipitation) experiments. Under the one-per-sequence
              model, it showed comparable performance with MEME in discovering
              motifs in ChIP-seq peak sequences. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that
              the LASAGNA algorithm is simple and effective in aligning
              variable-length binding sites. It has been integrated into a
              user-friendly webtool for TFBS search and visualization called
              LASAGNA-Search. The tool currently stores precomputed PSSM models

               precision: meaningful features that correlate strongly with
               biological functions can be found associated with only a few CpG

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Cellular functions are coordinately carried out by
              groups of genes forming functional modules. Identifying such
              modules in the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) of
              organisms is important for understanding the structure and
              function of these fundamental cellular networks and essential for
              the emerging modular biology. So far, the global connectivity
              structure of TRN has not been well studied and consequently not
              applied for the identification of functional modules. Moreover,
              network motifs such as feed forward loop are recently proposed to
              be basic building blocks of TRN. However, their relationship to
              functional modules is not clear. RESULTS: In this work we
              proposed a top-down approach to identify modules in the TRN of E.
              coli. By studying the global connectivity structure of the
              regulatory network, we first revealed a five-layer hierarchical
              structure in which all the regulatory relationships are downward.
              Based on this regulatory hierarchy, we developed a new method to
              decompose the regulatory network into functional modules and to
              identify global regulators governing multiple modules. As a
              result, 10 global regulators and 39 modules were identified and
              shown to have well defined functions. We then investigated the
              distribution and composition of the two basic network motifs
              (feed forward loop and bi-fan motif) in the hierarchical
              structure of TRN. We found that most of these network motifs
              include global regulators, indicating that these motifs are not
              basic building blocks of modules since modules should not contain
              global regulators. CONCLUSION: The transcriptional regulatory
              network of E. coli possesses a multi-layer hierarchical modular
              structure without feedback regulation at transcription level.
              This hierarchical structure builds the basis for a new and simple
              decomposition method which is suitable for the identification of
              functional modules and global regulators in the transcriptional
              regulatory network of E. coli. Analysis of the distribution of
              feed forward loops and bi-fan motifs in the hierarchical
              structure suggests that these network motifs are not elementary
              building blocks of functional modules in the transcriptional

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Massively parallel whole transcriptome sequencing,
              commonly referred as RNA-Seq, is quickly becoming the technology
              of choice for gene expression profiling. However, due to the
              short read length delivered by current sequencing technologies,
              estimation of expression levels for alternative splicing gene
              isoforms remains challenging. RESULTS: In this paper we present a
              novel expectation-maximization algorithm for inference of
              isoform- and gene-specific expression levels from RNA-Seq data.
              Our algorithm, referred to as IsoEM, is based on disambiguating
              information provided by the distribution of insert sizes
              generated during sequencing library preparation, and takes
              advantage of base quality scores, strand and read pairing
              information when available. The open source Java implementation
              of IsoEM is freely available at
              http://dna.engr.uconn.edu/software/IsoEM/. CONCLUSIONS: Empirical
              experiments on both synthetic and real RNA-Seq datasets show that
              IsoEM has scalable running time and outperforms existing methods
              of isoform and gene expression level estimation. Simulation
              experiments confirm previous findings that, for a fixed
              sequencing cost, using reads longer than 25-36 bases does not
              necessarily lead to better accuracy for estimating expression
              levels of annotated isoforms and genes.",

               than 100 transcription factors from about 500 ChIP-seq
               experiments in multiple cell types. While this large amount of
               data creates a valuable resource, it is nonetheless
               overwhelmingly complex and simultaneously incomplete since it
               covers only a small fraction of all human transcription factors.
               RESULTS: As part of the consortium effort in providing a concise
               abstraction of the data for facilitating various types of
               downstream analyses, we constructed statistical models that
               capture the genomic features of three paired types of regions by
               machine-learning methods: firstly, regions with active or
               inactive binding; secondly, those with extremely high or low
               degrees of co-binding, termed HOT and LOT regions; and finally,
               regulatory modules proximal or distal to genes. From the distal
               regulatory modules, we developed computational pipelines to
               identify potential enhancers, many of which were validated
               experimentally. We further associated the predicted enhancers
               with potential target transcripts and the transcription factors
               involved. For HOT regions, we found a significant fraction of
               transcription factor binding without clear sequence motifs and
               showed that this observation could be related to strong DNA

              human tissues and cell types, nor whether the resulting age
              prediction is a biologically meaningful measure. RESULTS: I
              developed a multi-tissue predictor of age that allows one to
              estimate the DNA methylation age of most tissues and cell types.
              The predictor, which is freely available, was developed using
              8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets,
              encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. I found that DNA
              methylation age has the following properties: first, it is close
              to zero for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells; second,
              it correlates with cell passage number; third, it gives rise to a
              highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is
              applicable to chimpanzee tissues. Analysis of 6,000 cancer
              samples from 32 datasets showed that all of the considered 20
              cancer types exhibit significant age acceleration, with an
              average of 36 years. Low age-acceleration of cancer tissue is
              associated with a high number of somatic mutations and TP53
              mutations, while mutations in steroid receptors greatly
              accelerate DNA methylation age in breast cancer. Finally, I
              characterize the 353 CpG sites that together form an aging clock
              in terms of chromatin states and tissue variance. CONCLUSIONS: I
              propose that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect

              profiles in peripheral blood have already been published.
              However, blood is a heterogeneous collection of different cell

              microscopy, automated image analysis is crucial in modern
              biology. Most applications require reliable cell nuclei
              segmentation. However, in many biological specimens cell nuclei
              are densely packed and appear to touch one another in the images.
              Therefore, a major difficulty of three-dimensional cell nuclei
              segmentation is the decomposition of cell nuclei that apparently
              touch each other. Current methods are highly adapted to a certain
              biological specimen or a specific microscope. They do not ensure
              similarly accurate segmentation performance, i.e. their
              robustness for different datasets is not guaranteed. Hence, these
              methods require elaborate adjustments to each dataset. RESULTS:
              We present an advanced three-dimensional cell nuclei segmentation
              algorithm that is accurate and robust. Our approach combines
              local adaptive pre-processing with decomposition based on
              Lines-of-Sight (LoS) to separate apparently touching cell nuclei
              into approximately convex parts. We demonstrate the superior
              performance of our algorithm using data from different specimens
              recorded with different microscopes. The three-dimensional images
              were recorded with confocal and light sheet-based fluorescence
              microscopes. The specimens are an early mouse embryo and two
              different cellular spheroids. We compared the segmentation
              accuracy of our algorithm with ground truth data for the test
              images and results from state-of-the-art methods. The analysis
              shows that our method is accurate throughout all test datasets
              (mean F-measure: 91\%) whereas the other methods each failed for
              at least one dataset (F-measure$\leq$69\%). Furthermore, nuclei
              volume measurements are improved for LoS decomposition. The
              state-of-the-art methods required laborious adjustments of
              parameter values to achieve these results. Our LoS algorithm did
              not require parameter value adjustments. The accurate performance
              was achieved with one fixed set of parameter values. CONCLUSION:
              We developed a novel and fully automated three-dimensional cell
              nuclei segmentation method incorporating LoS decomposition. LoS
              are easily accessible features that ensure correct splitting of
              apparently touching cell nuclei independent of their shape, size
              or intensity. Our method showed superior performance compared to
              state-of-the-art methods, performing accurately for a variety of
              test images. Hence, our LoS approach can be readily applied to

              persistent challenge in DNA methylome analysis is the accurate
              identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs)
              between samples. Sensitive and specific identification of DMRs
              among different conditions requires accurate and efficient
              algorithms, and while various tools have been developed to tackle
              this problem, they frequently suffer from inaccurate DMR boundary
              identification and high false positive rate. RESULTS: We present
              a novel Histogram Of MEthylation (HOME) based method that takes
              into account the inherent difference in the distribution of
              methylation levels between DMRs and non-DMRs to discriminate
              between the two using a Support Vector Machine. We show that
              generated features used by HOME are dataset-independent such that
              a classifier trained on, for example, a mouse methylome training
              set of regions of differentially accessible chromatin, can be
              applied to any other organism's dataset and identify accurate
              DMRs. We demonstrate that DMRs identified by HOME exhibit higher
              association with biologically relevant genes, processes, and
              regulatory events compared to the existing methods. Moreover,
              HOME provides additional functionalities lacking in most of the

              more accurate DMRs than the current state-of-the-art methods on
              both simulated and biological datasets. The broad applicability
              of HOME to identify accurate DMRs in genomic data from any

              generally disregarded, while alternative polyadenylation
              artifacts are attributed to internal priming. RESULTS: Here, we
              analyzed both long-read cDNA sequencing and direct RNA sequencing
              data of two organisms, generated by different sequencing
              platforms. We developed a filtering algorithm which takes into
              consideration that template-switching can be a source of
              artifactual polyadenylation when filtering out spurious
              polyadenylation sites. The algorithm outperformed the
              conventional internal priming filters based on comparison to
              direct RNA sequencing data. We also showed that the
              polyadenylation artifacts arise in cDNA sequencing at consecutive
              stretches of as few as three adenines. There was no substantial
              difference between the lengths of poly(A) tails at the
              artifactual and the true transcriptional end sites even though it
              is expected that internal priming artifacts have shorter poly(A)
              tails than genuine polyadenylated reads. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              findings suggest that template switching plays an important role
              in the generation of spurious polyadenylation and support the
              need for more rigorous filtering of artifactual polyadenylation
              sites in cDNA data, or that alternative polyadenylation should be
              annotated using native RNA sequencing.",

              transplant reception, and cancer presence and progression.
              Originally developed for the genomic analysis of highly degraded
              ancient DNA, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) library preparation
              methods are gaining popularity in the field of cfDNA analysis due
              to their efficiency and ability to convert short, fragmented DNA
              into sequencing libraries without altering DNA ends. However,
              current ssDNA methods are costly and time-consuming. RESULTS:
              Here we present an efficient ligation-based single-stranded
              library preparation method that is engineered to produce complex
              libraries in under 2.5 h from as little as 1 nanogram of input
              DNA without alteration to the native ends of template molecules.
              Our method, called Single Reaction Single-stranded LibrarY or
              SRSLY, ligates uniquely designed Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
              adapters in a one-step combined phosphorylation/ligation reaction
              that foregoes end-polishing. Using synthetic DNA oligos and
              cfDNA, we demonstrate the efficiency and utility of this approach
              and compare with existing double-stranded and single-stranded
              approaches for library generation. Finally, we demonstrate that
              cfDNA NGS data generated from SRSLY can be used to analyze DNA
              fragmentation patterns to deduce nucleosome positioning and
              transcription factor binding. CONCLUSIONS: SRSLY is a versatile
              tool for converting short and fragmented DNA molecules, like
              cfDNA fragments, into sequencing libraries while retaining native
              lengths and ends.",

              no major breakthrough has been made in the upstream library
              preparation methods until the transposase-based Nextera method
              was invented. Nextera combines DNA fragmentation and barcoding in
              a single tube reaction and therefore enables a very fast workflow
              to sequencing-ready DNA libraries within a couple of hours. When
              compared to the traditional ligation-based methods,
              transposed-based Nextera has a slight insertion bias. RESULTS:
              Here we present the discovery of a mutant transposase (Tn5-059)
              with a lowered GC insertion bias through protein engineering. We
              demonstrate Tn5-059 reduces AT dropout and increases uniformity
              of genome coverage in both bacterial genomes and human genome. We
              also observe higher library diversity generated by Tn5-059 when
              compared to Nextera v2 for human exomes, which leads to less
              sequencing and lower cost per genome. In addition, when used for
              human exomes, Tn5-059 delivers consistent library insert size
              over a range of input DNA, allowing up to a tenfold variance from
              the 50 ng input recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced DNA input
              tolerance of Tn5-059 can translate to flexibility and robustness

              underlying this regional heterogeneity are not known. We
              previously identified a niche mechanism regulating proliferation
              and neuronal development in the adult mouse dentate gyrus
              resulting from the activity-regulated expression of secreted
              frizzled-related protein 3 (sfrp3) by mature neurons, which
              suppresses activation of radial glia-like neural stem cells
              (RGLs) through inhibition of Wingless/INT (WNT) protein

              RESULTS: We use whole genome bisulfite sequencing, and find that
              differentiation of mouse colonic intestinal stem cells to
              intestinal epithelium is not associated with major changes in DNA
              methylation. However, we detect extensive dynamic epigenetic
              changes in intestinal stem cells and their progeny during the
              suckling period, suggesting postnatal epigenetic development in
              this stem cell population. We find that postnatal DNA methylation
              increases at 3' CpG islands (CGIs) correlate with transcriptional
              activation of glycosylation genes responsible for intestinal
              maturation. To directly test whether 3' CGI methylation regulates
              transcription, we conditionally disrupted two major DNA
              methyltransferases, Dnmt1 or Dnmt3a, in fetal and adult
              intestine. Deficiency of Dnmt1 causes severe intestinal
              abnormalities in neonates and disrupts crypt homeostasis in
              adults, whereas Dnmt3a loss was compatible with intestinal
              development. These studies reveal that 3' CGI methylation is
              functionally involved in the regulation of transcriptional
              activation in vivo, and that Dnmt1 is a critical regulator of
              postnatal epigenetic changes in intestinal stem cells. Finally,

              differentiating and replicating cells. The lowest level of
              methylation is observed in highly proliferating and immortal
              cancer cell lines. A decrease of DNA methylation within partially
              methylated domains tends to be linked to an increase in
              heterochromatic histone marks and a decrease of gene expression.
              Characteristic combinations of heterochromatic signatures in
              partially methylated domains are linked to domains of early and
              middle S-phase and late S-G2 phases of DNA replication.
              CONCLUSIONS: Partially methylated domains are prominent
              signatures of long-range epigenomic organization. Integrative
              analysis identifies them as important general, lineage- and cell
              type-specific topological features. Changes in partially
              methylated domains are hallmarks of cell differentiation, with
              decreased methylation levels and increased heterochromatic marks
              being linked to enhanced cell proliferation. In combination with
              broad histone marks, partially methylated domains demarcate
              distinct domains of late DNA replication.",

              hypotheses are typically tested. Statistical methods that control
              the false discovery rate (FDR) have emerged as popular and
              powerful tools for error rate control. While classic FDR methods
              use only p values as input, more modern FDR methods have been
              shown to increase power by incorporating complementary
              information as informative covariates to prioritize, weight, and
              group hypotheses. However, there is currently no consensus on how
              the modern methods compare to one another. We investigate the
              accuracy, applicability, and ease of use of two classic and six
              modern FDR-controlling methods by performing a systematic
              benchmark comparison using simulation studies as well as six case
              studies in computational biology. RESULTS: Methods that
              incorporate informative covariates are modestly more powerful
              than classic approaches, and do not underperform classic
              approaches, even when the covariate is completely uninformative.
              The majority of methods are successful at controlling the FDR,
              with the exception of two modern methods under certain settings.
              Furthermore, we find that the improvement of the modern FDR
              methods over the classic methods increases with the
              informativeness of the covariate, total number of hypothesis
              tests, and proportion of truly non-null hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS:
              Modern FDR methods that use an informative covariate provide
              advantages over classic FDR-controlling procedures, with the
              relative gain dependent on the application and informativeness of
              available covariates. We present our findings as a practical

              RESULTS: We compare 14 methods in terms of computational runtime,

              regions of concordant differential methylation spanning multiple
              CpG sites (differentially methylated regions). Variation limited
              to single or small numbers of CpGs has been assumed to reflect
              stochastic processes. To test this, we developed software,
              Cluster-Based analysis of CpG methylation (CluBCpG), and explored
              variation in read-level CpG methylation patterns in whole genome
              bisulfite sequencing data. RESULTS: Analysis of both human and
              mouse whole genome bisulfite sequencing datasets reveals
              read-level signatures associated with cell type and cell
              type-specific biological processes. These signatures, which are
              mostly orthogonal to classical differentially methylated regions,
              are enriched at cell type-specific enhancers and allow estimation
              of proportional cell composition in synthetic mixtures and
              improved prediction of gene expression. In tandem, we developed a
              machine learning algorithm, Precise Read-Level Imputation of

              genome bisulfite sequencing datasets by imputing CpG methylation

  abstract  = "In the mammalian cerebral cortex neurons are arranged in
               specific layers and form connections both within the cortex and
               with other brain regions, thus forming a complex mesh of
               specialized synaptic connections comprising distinct circuits.
               The correct establishment of these connections during
               development is crucial for the proper function of the brain.
               Astrocytes, a major type of glial cell, are important regulators
               of synapse formation and function during development. While
               neurogenesis precedes astrogenesis in the cortex, neuronal
               synapses only begin to form after astrocytes have been
               generated, concurrent with neuronal branching and process
               elaboration. Here we provide a combined overview of the
               developmental processes of synapse and circuit formation in the
               rodent cortex, emphasizing the timeline of both neuronal and
               astrocytic development and maturation. We further discuss the

              Endothelial cells form the inner lining of the vessel wall, and

              muscle cells or mural cells--envelop the surface of the vascular
              tube. Over the last decades, studies of blood vessels have
              concentrated mainly on the endothelial cell component, especially
              when the first angiogenic factors were discovered, while the
              interest in pericytes has lagged behind. Pericytes are, however,
              functionally significant; when vessels lose pericytes, they

              such as edema, diabetic retinopathy, and even embryonic

              functional and critical contributors to tumor angiogenesis and

               development and application of a broad range of clustering
               methods, based on various underlying algorithms. Here, we
               provide a systematic and extensible performance evaluation of 14
               clustering algorithms implemented in R, including both methods
               developed explicitly for scRNA-seq data and more general-purpose
               methods. The methods were evaluated using nine publicly
               available scRNA-seq data sets as well as three simulations with
               varying degree of cluster separability. The same feature
               selection approaches were used for all methods, allowing us to
               focus on the investigation of the performance of the clustering
               algorithms themselves. We evaluated the ability of recovering
               known subpopulations, the stability and the run time and
               scalability of the methods. Additionally, we investigated
               whether the performance could be improved by generating
               consensus partitions from multiple individual clustering
               methods. We found substantial differences in the performance,
               run time and stability between the methods, with SC3 and Seurat
               showing the most favorable results. Additionally, we found that
               consensus clustering typically did not improve the performance
               compared to the best of the combined methods, but that several
               of the top-performing methods already perform some type of
               consensus clustering. All the code used for the evaluation is

  title    = "False signals induced by single-cell imputation",
  author   = "Andrews, Tallulah S and Hemberg, Martin",
  abstract = "Background: Single-cell RNA-seq is a powerful tool for measuring
              gene expression at the resolution of individual cells. A
              challenge in the analysis of this data is the large amount of
              zero values, representing either missing data or no expression.
              Several imputation approaches have been proposed to address this
              issue, but they generally rely on structure inherent to the
              dataset under consideration they may not provide any additional
              information, hence, are limited by the information contained
              therein and the validity of their assumptions. Methods: We
              evaluated the risk of generating false positive or irreproducible
              differential expression when imputing data with six different
              methods. We applied each method to a variety of simulated
              datasets as well as to permuted real single-cell RNA-seq datasets
              and consider the number of false positive gene-gene correlations
              and differentially expressed genes. Using matched 10X and
              Smart-seq2 data we examined whether cell-type specific markers
              were reproducible across datasets derived from the same tissue
              before and after imputation. Results: The extent of
              false-positives introduced by imputation varied considerably by
              method. Data smoothing based methods, MAGIC, knn-smooth and dca,
              generated many false-positives in both real and simulated data.
              Model-based imputation methods typically generated fewer
              false-positives but this varied greatly depending on the
              diversity of cell-types in the sample. All imputation methods
              decreased the reproducibility of cell-type specific markers,
              although this could be mitigated by selecting markers with large
              effect size and significance. Conclusions: Imputation of
              single-cell RNA-seq data introduces circularity that can generate
              false-positive results. Thus, statistical tests applied to
              imputed data should be treated with care. Additional filtering by
              effect size can reduce but not fully eliminate these effects. Of
              the methods we considered, SAVER was the least likely to generate
              false or irreproducible results, thus should be favoured over
              alternatives if imputation is necessary.",

               studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the
               transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a
               first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for
               abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest,

               we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical
               inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in
               terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate

              this list may be incomplete; additionally, it is unclear whether
              discrete classes are sufficient to describe the diversity of
              cortical inhibitory neurons or whether continuous modes of
              variability are also required. We studied the transcriptomes of
              3,663 CA1 inhibitory cells, revealing 10 major GABAergic groups
              that divided into 49 fine-scale clusters. All previously
              described and several novel cell classes were identified, with
              three previously described classes unexpectedly found to be

              Latent factor analysis revealed that a single continuous variable

  abstract = "Human visual cortex is organized with striking consistency across
              individuals. While recent findings demonstrate an unexpected
              coupling between functional and cytoarchitectonic regions
              relative to the folding of human visual cortex, a unifying
              principle linking these anatomical and functional features of the
              cortex remains elusive. To fill this gap in knowledge, we
              combined independent and ground truth measurements of
              cytoarchitectonic regions and genetic tissue characterization
              within human occipitotemporal cortex. Using a data-driven
              approach, we examined whether differential gene expression among
              cytoarchitectonic areas could contribute to the arealization of
              occipitotemporal cortex into a hierarchy based on
              transcriptomics. This approach revealed two opposing gene
              expression gradients: one that contains a series of genes with
              expression magnitudes that ascend from posterior (e.g., areas
              human occipital [hOc]1, hOc2, hOc3, etc.) to anterior
              cytoarchitectonic areas (e.g., areas fusiform gyrus [FG]1-FG4)
              and another that contains a separate series of genes that show a
              descending gradient from posterior to anterior areas. Using data
              from the living human brain, we show that each of these gradients
              correlates strongly with variations in measures related to either
              thickness or myelination of cortex, respectively. We further
              reveal that these genetic gradients emerge along unique
              trajectories in human development: the ascending gradient is
              present at 10-12 gestational weeks, while the descending gradient
              emerges later (19-24 gestational weeks). Interestingly, it is not
              until early childhood (before 5 years of age) that the two
              expression gradients achieve their adult-like mean expression
              values. Additional analyses in nonhuman primates (NHPs) reveal
              that homologous genes do not generate the same ascending and
              descending expression gradients as in humans. We discuss these
              findings relative to previously proposed hierarchies based on
              functional and cytoarchitectonic features of visual cortex.
              Altogether, these findings bridge macroscopic features of human
              cytoarchitectonic areas in visual cortex with microscopic
              features of cellular organization and genetic expression, which,
              despite the complexity of this multiscale correspondence, can be
              described by a sparse subset (approximately 200) of genes. These
              findings help pinpoint the genes contributing to healthy cortical
              development and explicate the cortical biology distinguishing
              humans from other primates, as well as establishing essential

              maps of mouse germ cells, generated using whole-genome shotgun
              bisulfite sequencing and cDNA sequencing (mRNA-seq). Oocyte
              genomes showed a significant positive correlation between mRNA
              transcript levels and methylation of the transcribed region.
              Sperm genomes had nearly complete coverage of methylation, except
              in the CpG-rich regions, and showed a significant negative
              correlation between gene expression and promoter methylation.
              Thus, these methylome maps revealed that oocytes and sperms are
              widely different in the extent and distribution of DNA
              methylation. Furthermore, a comparison of oocyte and sperm
              methylomes identified more than 1,600 CpG islands differentially
              methylated in oocytes and sperm (germline differentially
              methylated regions, gDMRs), in addition to the known imprinting

              methylated DNA sequences appear to be at least partially
              resistant to the global DNA demethylation that occurs during
              preimplantation development. In the absence of Dnmt3L, neither
              methylation of most oocyte-methylated gDMRs nor intragenic

              Dnmt3L-dependent gDMRs at intragenic regions, the present results
              suggest that oocyte methylation can be divided into 2 types:
              Dnmt3L-dependent methylation, which is required for maternal
              methylation imprinting, and Dnmt3L-independent methylation, which

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: We recently showed that enzymes of the TET family
              convert 5-mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in DNA. 5-hmC is
              present at high levels in embryonic stem cells and Purkinje
              neurons. The methylation status of cytosines is typically
              assessed by reaction with sodium bisulfite followed by PCR
              amplification. Reaction with sodium bisulfite promotes cytosine
              deamination, whereas 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) reacts poorly with
              bisulfite and is resistant to deamination. Since 5-hmC reacts
              with bisulfite to yield cytosine 5-methylenesulfonate (CMS), we
              asked how DNA containing 5-hmC behaves in bisulfite sequencing.
              METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used synthetic
              oligonucleotides with different distributions of cytosine as
              templates for generation of DNAs containing C, 5-mC and 5-hmC.
              The resulting DNAs were subjected in parallel to bisulfite
              treatment, followed by exposure to conditions promoting cytosine
              deamination. The extent of conversion of 5-hmC to CMS was
              estimated to be 99.7\%. Sequencing of PCR products showed that
              neither 5-mC nor 5-hmC undergo C-to-T transitions after bisulfite
              treatment, confirming that these two modified cytosine species
              are indistinguishable by the bisulfite technique. DNA in which
              CMS constituted a large fraction of all bases (28/201) was much
              less efficiently amplified than DNA in which those bases were
              5-mC or uracil (the latter produced by cytosine deamination).
              Using a series of primer extension experiments, we traced the
              inefficient amplification of CMS-containing DNA to stalling of
              Taq polymerase at sites of CMS modification, especially when two
              CMS bases were either adjacent to one another or separated by 1-2
              nucleotides. CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed that the widely used
              bisulfite sequencing technique does not distinguish between 5-mC
              and 5-hmC. Moreover, we show that CMS, the product of bisulfite
              conversion of 5-hmC, tends to stall DNA polymerases during PCR,
              suggesting that densely hydroxymethylated regions of DNA may be
              underrepresented in quantitative methylation analyses.",

              5'-two base overhangs). This analysis revealed that T4 DNA
              ligase, the most common enzyme utilized for in vitro ligation,
              had its greatest activity on blunt- and 2-base overhangs, and

              increased binding affinity for DNA and increased activity, but
              did not alter the relative substrate preferences of PBCV1 DNA

              intrinsic membrane and firing properties that allow cortical FS

              equally specialized gene expression, which is ultimately
              coordinated by cell-type-specific transcriptional regulation.
              Although embryonic transcriptional events govern the initial
              steps of cell-type specification in most cortical interneurons,
              including FS cells, the electrophysiological properties that

              this maturational process are not known. To address this, we used
              mouse whole-genome microarrays and whole-cell patch clamp to

  abstract = "Amacrine cells (ACs) are a diverse class of interneurons that
              modulate input from photoreceptors to retinal ganglion cells
              (RGCs), rendering each RGC type selectively sensitive to
              particular visual features, which are then relayed to the brain.
              While many AC types have been identified morphologically and
              physiologically, they have not been comprehensively classified or
              molecularly characterized. We used high-throughput single-cell
              RNA sequencing to profile >32,000 ACs from mice of both sexes and
              applied computational methods to identify 63 AC types. We
              identified molecular markers for each type and used them to
              characterize the morphology of multiple types. We show that they
              include nearly all previously known AC types as well as many that
              had not been described. Consistent with previous studies, most of
              the AC types expressed markers for the canonical inhibitory
              neurotransmitters GABA or glycine, but several expressed neither
              or both. In addition, many expressed one or more neuropeptides,
              and two expressed glutamatergic markers. We also explored
              transcriptomic relationships among AC types and identified
              transcription factors expressed by individual or multiple closely
              related types. Noteworthy among these were Meis2 and Tcf4,
              expressed by most GABAergic and most glycinergic types,
              respectively. Together, these results provide a foundation for
              developmental and functional studies of ACs, as well as means for
              genetically accessing them. Along with previous molecular,
              physiological, and morphologic analyses, they establish the
              existence of at least 130 neuronal types and nearly 140 cell
              types in the mouse retina.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The mouse retina
              is a leading model for analyzing the development, structure,
              function, and pathology of neural circuits. A complete molecular
              atlas of retinal cell types provides an important foundation for
              these studies. We used high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing
              to characterize the most heterogeneous class of retinal
              interneurons, amacrine cells, identifying 63 distinct types. The
              atlas includes types identified previously as well as many novel
              types. We provide evidence for the use of multiple
              neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, and identify transcription
              factors expressed by groups of closely related types. Combining
              these results with those obtained previously, we proposed that
              the mouse retina contains ∼130 neuronal types and is therefore
              comparable in complexity to other regions of the brain.",

  title     = "Origin and Molecular Specification of Striatal Interneurons",
  author    = "Mar{\i}́n, Oscar and Anderson, Stewart A and Rubenstein, John L
               R",
  abstract  = "The striatum, the largest component of the basal ganglia,
               contains projection neurons and interneurons. Whereas there is
               considerable agreement that the lateral ganglionic eminence
               (LGE) is the origin of striatal projection neurons, less is
               known about the origin of striatal interneurons. Using focal
               injections of retrovirus into the ventral telencephalon in
               vitro, we demonstrate that most striatal interneurons
               tangentially migrate from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)
               or the adjacent preoptic/anterior entopeduncular areas (POa/AEP)
               and express the NKX2.1 homeodomain protein. Although the
               majority of striatal interneurons (cholinergic, calretinin+, and
               parvalbumin+) maintain the expression of NKX2.1 into adulthood,
               most of the interneurons expressing somatostatin (SOM),
               neuropeptide Y (NPY), and neural nitric oxide synthase (NOS)
               appear to downregulate the expression of NKX2.1 as they exit the
               neuroepithelium. Analysis of striatal development in mice
               lacking Nkx2.1 suggests that this gene is required for the
               specification of nearly all striatal interneurons. Similar
               analysis of mice lacking the Mash1basic helix--loop--helix
               (bHLH) or both the Dlx1 andDlx2 homeodomain transcription
               factors demonstrates that these genes are required for the
               differentiation of striatal interneurons. Mash1 mutants
               primarily have a reduction in early-born striatal interneurons,
               whereas Dlx1/2mutants primarily have reduced numbers of
               late-born striatal interneurons. We also present evidence
               implicating theLhx6 and Lhx7 LIM-homeobox genes in the
               development of distinct interneuron subtypes. Finally, we
               hypothesize that, within the MGE, radially migrating cells
               generally become projection neurons, whereas tangentially
               migrating cells mainly form interneurons of the striatum and

              somatosensory cortex, and their activity powerfully shapes
              sensory processing. Three major groups of GABAergic interneurons
              have been defined according to developmental, molecular,
              morphological, electrophysiological, and synaptic features.
              Dendritic-targeting somatostatin-expressing interneurons
              (SST-INs) have been shown to display diverse morphological,
              electrophysiological, and molecular properties and activity
              patterns in vivo However, the correlation between these
              properties and SST-IN subtype is unclear. In this study, we aimed
              to correlate the morphological diversity of layer 5 (L5) SST-INs
              with their electrophysiological and molecular diversity in mice
              of either sex. Our morphological analysis demonstrated the
              existence of three subtypes of L5 SST-INs with distinct
              electrophysiological properties: T-shaped Martinotti cells
              innervate L1, and are low-threshold spiking; fanning-out
              Martinotti cells innervate L2/3 and the lower half of L1, and
              show adapting firing patterns; non-Martinotti cells innervate L4,
              and show a quasi-fast spiking firing pattern. We estimated the
              proportion of each subtype in L5 and found that T-shaped
              Martinotti, fanning-out Martinotti, and Non-Martinotti cells
              represent ∼10, ∼50, and ∼40\% of L5 SST-INs, respectively. Last,
              we examined the connectivity between the three SST-IN subtypes
              and L5 pyramidal cells (PCs). We found that L5 T-shaped
              Martinotti cells inhibit the L1 apical tuft of nearby PCs; L5
              fanning-out Martinotti cells also inhibit nearby PCs but they
              target the dendrite mainly in L2/3. On the other hand,
              non-Martinotti cells inhibit the dendrites of L4 neurons while
              avoiding L5 PCs. Our data suggest that morphologically distinct
              SST-INs gate different excitatory inputs in the barrel
              cortex.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Morphologically diverse layer 5
              SST-INs show different patterns of activity in behaving animals.
              However, little is known about the abundance and connectivity of
              each morphological type and the correlation between morphological
              subtype and spiking properties. We demonstrate a correlation
              between the morphological and electrophysiological diversity of
              layer 5 SST-INs. Based on these findings we built a classifier to
              infer the abundance of each morphological subtype. Last, using
              paired recordings combined with morphological analysis, we
              investigated the connectivity of each morphological subtype. Our
              data suggest that, by targeting different cell types and cellular
              compartments, morphologically diverse SST-INs might gate

              interneuron type (NPY-neurogliaform) differed from previously
              described NPY-PLTS interneurons by exhibiting a significantly
              lower input resistance and hyperpolarized membrane potential,
              regular, nonaccommodating spiking in response to depolarizing

              easily distinguished morphologically by their dense, compact, and
              highly branched dendritic and local axonal arborizations that

              NPY-PLTS interneurons. In contrast, the probability of SPN
              innervation by NPY-neurogliaform interneurons was extremely high,
              the synapse very reliable (no failures were observed), and the

              Aided by the transgene expression, the characterization of

              the brain, as well as to allow fitting a large cortex in a
              limited cranial volume. Pathological alterations in size or
              folding of the human cortex lead to severe intellectual
              disability and intractable epilepsy. Hence, cortical expansion
              and folding are viewed as key processes in mammalian brain
              development and evolution, ultimately leading to increased
              intellectual performance and, eventually, to the emergence of
              human cognition. Here, we provide an overview and discuss some of
              the most significant advances in our understanding of cortical
              expansion and folding over the last decades. These include
              discoveries in multiple and diverse disciplines, from cellular
              and molecular mechanisms regulating cortical development and
              neurogenesis, genetic mechanisms defining the patterns of
              cortical folds, the biomechanics of cortical growth and buckling,
              lessons from human disease, and how genetic evolution steered

              analysis",
  author   = "Zhang, Bin and Horvath, Steve",
  abstract = "Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the
              system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is
              conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are
              connected if the corresponding genes are significantly
              co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In
              reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes
              in such networks. An important question is whether it is
              biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary
              information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general
              framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection
              weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a
              weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we
              propose several adjacency functions that convert the
              co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the
              parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically
              motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology
              criterion). We generalize the following important network
              concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce
              several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence
              that they can be important for predicting the biological
              significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and
              empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap
              measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive
              modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize
              the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the
              unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering
              coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We
              provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between
              clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard
              thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer
              microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.",

               a fluorescent marker, enhanced green fluorescent protein,
               specifically and selectively only in neurons of a certain
               genetic makeup (e.g., parvalbumin-, neuropeptide Y-, or tyrosine
               hydroxylase-expressing neurons etc.) have led to the ability of
               electrophysiologists to visualize and patch specific neuron
               types in brain slices with epifluorescence illumination. This
               has led to a rapid expansion of the number of neurochemically
               and/or electrophysiologically identified interneuronal cell
               types in the striatum and elsewhere. This article will review
               the anatomy, neurochemistry, electrophysiology, synaptic
               connections, and function of the three ``classic'' striatal
               GABAergic interneurons as well as more recent data derived from
               in vitro recordings from BAC transgenic mice as well as recent

              an additional component of the anterior olfactory nucleus or
              alpha AON that lies underneath of the AOB. The OL consists of a
              modified bulbar cortex bounded anteriorly by the MOB and
              posteriorly by the AOB. In Nissl-stained specimens the OL differs
              from the MOB by a progressive, antero-posterior decrease in
              thickness or absence of the external plexiform, mitral/tufted
              cell, and granule cell layers. On cytoarchitectual grounds the OL
              is divided from rostral to caudal into three distinct components:
              a stripe of glomerular-free cortex or preolfactory area (PA), a
              second or necklace glomerular area, and a wedge-shaped or
              interstitial area (INA) crowned by the so-called modified
              glomeruli that appear to belong to the anterior AOB. The
              strategic location and interactions with the main and AOBs,

              modalities. The alpha component of the anterior olfactory
              nucleus, a slender cellular cluster (i.e., 650 $\times$ 150
              $\mu$m) paralleling the base of the AOB, contains two neuron
              types: a pyramidal-like neuron and an interneuron. Dendrites of
              pyramidal-like cells (P-L) organize into a single bundle that

              edge of the OL, the AOB and the dorsal part of the anterior

  abstract = "How are neurons distributed along the cortical surface and across
              functional areas? Here we use the isotropic fractionator
              (Herculano-Houzel and Lent, 2005) to analyze the distribution of
              neurons across the entire isocortex of the mouse, divided into 18
              functional areas defined anatomically. We find that the number of
              neurons underneath a surface area (the N/A ratio) varies 4.5-fold
              across functional areas and neuronal density varies 3.2-fold. The
              face area of S1 contains the most neurons, followed by motor
              cortex and the primary visual cortex. Remarkably, while the
              distribution of neurons across functional areas does not
              accompany the distribution of surface area, it mirrors closely
              the distribution of cortical volumes-with the exception of the
              visual areas, which hold more neurons than expected for their
              volume. Across the non-visual cortex, the volume of individual
              functional areas is a shared linear function of their number of
              neurons, while in the visual areas, neuronal densities are much
              higher than in all other areas. In contrast, the 18 functional
              areas cluster into three different zones according to the
              relationship between the N/A ratio and cortical thickness and
              neuronal density: these three clusters can be called visual,
              sensory, and, possibly, associative. These findings are
              remarkably similar to those in the human cerebral cortex (Ribeiro
              et al., 2013) and suggest that, like the human cerebral cortex,
              the mouse cerebral cortex comprises two zones that differ in how
              neurons form the cortical volume, and three zones that differ in
              how neurons are distributed underneath the cortical surface,
              possibly in relation to local differences in connectivity through
              the white matter. Our results suggest that beyond the
              developmental divide into visual and non-visual cortex,
              functional areas initially share a common distribution of neurons
              along the parenchyma that become delimited into functional areas

              special role in this process. CpGs enable epigenome variability

              regulatory mechanism. Therefore, species-specific CpGs may
              influence species-specific regulation. We report non-polymorphic

              cell-type-specific enhancers that should enable genetic access
              and perturbation of gene function across mammalian cell types.
              Focusing on the highly heterogeneous mammalian cerebral cortex,

              may mimic the effect of mutations of various tumor suppressor
              genes (TSGs) or protooncogenes. Carcinogenesis can also result
              from aberrations in genomic DNA methylation that include
              hypermethylation and hypomethylation of promoter or first exon of
              cancer-related genes. Hypermethylation of promoter of various
              TSGs causes their transcriptional silencing. However,
              hypomethylation of regulatory DNA sequences activates
              transcription of protooncogenes, retrotransposons, as well as
              genes encoding proteins involved in genomic instability and
              malignant cell metastasis. The methylation of genomic DNA in
              malignant cells is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and
              DNMT3B, revealing significantly elevated expression in different
              types of cancers. The reversibility of hypermethylation can be
              used as target of therapeutic treatment in cancer. DNMT 1 and
              DNMT3B inhibitors including 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine and antisense
              oligonucleotides have been applied in clinical trials of such
              treatment. Identification of aberrations of DNA methylation in
              cancer cells is a new field of investigation in carcinogenesis.
              We believe that epigenetic cancer diagnostic and therapy will be
              achieved in the next decades.",

               controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach,

               to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It
               calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely
               rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is
               equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is
               smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of
               the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is
               desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple
               sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the

               simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

              extract patterns among higher-order interactions that are
              critically important in many real world problems. Current
              approaches designed for hypergraphs, however, are unable to
              handle different types of hypergraphs and are typically not
